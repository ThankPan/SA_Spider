Clustering of genes and associating each group with biological functions are often used methods. However, such methods only detect partial changes within cell processes. Herein, we propose a method for discovering global changes within a cell by associating observed conditions of gene expression with gene functions. To elucidate the association, we introduce a novel feature selection method called Least-Squares Mutual Information (LSMI), which computes mutual information without density estimaion, and therefore LSMI can detect nonlinear associations within a cell. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LSMI through comparison with existing methods. The results of the application to yeast microarray datasets reveal that non-natural stimuli affect various biological processes, whereas others are no significant relation to specific cell processes. Furthermore, we discover that biological processes can be categorized into four types according to the responses of various stimuli: DNA/RNA metabolism, gene expression, protein metabolism, and protein localization. We proposed a novel feature selection method called LSMI, and applied LSMI to mining the association between conditions of yeast and biological processes through microarray datasets.

We discuss the problem of active learning in linear regression scenarios. Traditional active learning methods using least-squares learning often assume that the model used for learning is correctly specified. In many practical situations, however, this assumption may not be fulfilled. Recently, active learning methods using\" importance\"-weighted least-squares learning have been proposed, which are shown to be robust against misspecification of models. In this paper, we propose a new active learning method also using the weighted least-squares learning, which we call ALICE (Active Learning using the Importance-weighted least-squares learning based on Conditional Expectation of the generalization error). An important difference from existing methods is that we predict the conditional expectation of the generalization error given training input points, while existing methods predict the full expectation of the generalization error. Due to this difference, the training input design can be fine-tuned depending on the realization of training input points. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed active learning criterion is a more accurate predictor of the single-trial generalization error than the existing criterion. Numerical studies with toy and benchmark data sets show that the proposed method compares favorably to existing methods.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：114"}, "url": "http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v7/sugiyama06a.html", "title": "Active learning in approximately linear regression based on conditional expectation of generalization error"}

As the power of computing has grown over the past few decades, the field of machine learning has advanced rapidly in both theory and practice. Machine learning methods are usually based on the assumption that the data generation mechanism does not change over time. Yet real-world applications of machine learning, including image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, robot control, and bioinformatics, often violate this common assumption. Dealing with non-stationarity is one of modern machine learning's greatest challenges. This book focuses on a specific non-stationary environment known as covariate shift, in which the distributions of inputs (queries) change but the conditional distribution of outputs (answers) is unchanged, and presents machine learning theory, algorithms, and applications to overcome this variety of non-stationarity. After reviewing the state-of-the-art research in the field, the authors discuss topics that include learning under covariate shift, model selection, importance estimation, and active learning. They describe such real world applications of covariate shift adaption as brain-computer interface, speaker identification, and age prediction from facial images.

However, this assumption is not satisfied, for example, when the outside of the training region is extrapolated. The situation where the training input points and test input points follow different distributions while the conditional distribution of output values given input points is unchanged is called the covariate shift. Under the covariate shift, standard model selection techniques such as cross validation do not work as desired since its unbiasedness is no longer maintained. In this paper, we propose a new method called importance weighted cross validation (IWCV), for which we prove its unbiasedness even under the covariate shift. The IWCV procedure is the only one that can be applied for unbiased classification under covariate shift, whereas alternatives to IWCV exist for regression. The usefulness of our proposed method is illustrated by simulations, and furthermore demonstrated in the brain-computer interface, where strong non-stationarity effects can be seen between training and test sessions.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：453"}, "url": "http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v8/sugiyama07a.html", "title": "Covariate shift adaptation by importance weighted cross validation"}

For regaining consistency, the log-likelihood terms need to be weighted according to the\\emph {importance}(ie, the ratio of test and training input densities). Thus, accurately estimating the importance is one of the key tasks in covariate shift adaptation. A naive approach is to first estimate training and test input densities and then estimate the importance by the ratio of the density estimates. However, since density estimation is a hard problem, this approach tends to perform poorly especially in high dimensional cases. In this paper, we propose a direct importance estimation method that does not require the input density estimates. Our method is equipped with a natural model selection procedure so tuning parameters such as the kernel width can be objectively optimized. This is an advantage over a recently developed method of direct importance estimation.

Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) is a traditional technique for supervised dimensionality reduction, but it tends to give undesired results if samples in a class are multimodal. An unsupervised dimensionality reduction method called locality-preserving projection (LPP) can work well with multimodal data due to its locality preserving property. However, since LPP does not take the label information into account, it is not necessarily useful in supervised learning scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new linear supervised dimensionality reduction method called local Fisher discriminant analysis (LFDA), which effectively combines the ideas of FDA and LPP. LFDA has an analytic form of the embedding transformation and the solution can be easily computed just by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. We demonstrate the practical usefulness and high scalability of the LFDA method in data visualization and classification tasks through extensive simulation studies.

However, tomographic imaging of live cells is challenging mainly because they are transparent, i.e., weakly scattering structures. Therefore, this type of imaging has been implemented largely using fluorescence techniques. While confocal fluorescence imaging is a common approach to achieve sectioning, it requires fluorescence probes that are often harmful to the living specimen. On the other hand, by using the intrinsic contrast of the structures it is possible to study living cells in a non-invasive manner. One method that provides high-resolution quantitative information about nanoscale structures is a broadband interferometric technique known as Spatial Light Interference Microscopy (SLIM). In addition to rendering quantitative phase information, when combined with a high numerical aperture objective, SLIM also provides excellent depth sectioning capabilities. However, like in all linear optical systems, SLIM's resolution is limited by diffraction. Here we present a novel 3D field deconvolution algorithm that exploits the sparsity of phase images and renders images with resolution beyond the diffraction limit.

Content such as tutorials, blog articles and lecture notes is becoming more prevalent in many technical disciplines and provides up-to-date technical coverage with widely different levels of prerequisite assumptions on the part of the reader. We propose a task of organizing heterogeneous educational resources on the web into a structure akin to a textbook or a course, allowing the learner to navigate a sequence of webpages that take them from point A (their prior knowledge) to point B (material they want to learn). We approach this task by 1) performing a shallow term-level classification of what concepts are explained and assumed in any given text, and 2) using this representation to connect web resources that explain concepts to those web resources where the same concepts are assumed. The main contributions of this paper are 1) a supervised classification approach to identifying explained and assumed terms in a document and 2) an algorithm for finding optimal paths through the web resources given the constraints of the user’s goal and prior knowledge.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：4"}, "url": "https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED592743", "title": "Web as a textbook: Curating Targeted Learning Paths through the Heterogeneous Learning Resources on the Web."}

Solving this problem involves both learning to interpret open ended natural language statements, and learning the concept itself. We present a joint model for (1) language interpretation (semantic parsing) and (2) concept learning (classification) that does not require labeling statements with logical forms. Instead, the model prefers discriminative interpretations of statements in context of observable features of the data as a weak signal for parsing.

The success of many learning schemes, in their attempts to construct models of data, hinges on the reliable identification of a small set of highly predictive attributes.  The inclusion of irrelevant, redundant and noisy attributes in the model building process phase can result in poor predictive performance and increased computation.  Attribute selection generally involves a combination of search and attribute utility estimation plus evaluation with respect to specific learning schemes.  This leads to a large number of possible permutation and has led to a situation where very few benchmark studies have been conducted. This paper presents a benchmark comparison of several attribute selection methods for supervised classification.  All the methods produce an attribute ranking, a useful devise for isolating the individual merit of an attribute. Attribute selection is achieved by cross-validating the attribute rankings with respect to a classification learner to find the best attributes.  Results are reported for a selection of standard data sets and two diverse learning schemes C4.5 and naïve Bayes.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：1203"}, "url": "https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/handle/10289/1013", "title": "Benchmarking attribute selection techniques for discrete class data mining"}

The Cascade SVM can be spread over multiple processors with minimal communication overhead and requires far less memory, since the kernel matrices are much smaller than for a regular SVM. Convergence to the global optimum is guaranteed with multiple passes through the Cascade, but already a single pass provides good generalization. A single pass is 5x–10x faster than a regular SVM for problems of 100,000 vectors when implemented on a single processor.

The success of CNNs is attributed to their ability to learn rich mid-level image representations as opposed to hand-designed low-level features used in other image classification methods. Learning CNNs, however, amounts to estimating millions of parameters and requires a very large number of annotated image samples. This property currently prevents application of CNNs to problems with limited training data. In this work we show how image representations learned with CNNs on large-scale annotated datasets can be efficiently transferred to other visual recognition tasks with limited amount of training data. We design a method to reuse layers trained on the ImageNet dataset to compute mid-level image representation for images in the PASCAL VOC dataset. We show that despite differences in image statistics and tasks in the two datasets, the transferred representation leads to significantly improved results for object and action classification, outperforming the current state of the art on Pascal VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets.

Given an appropriate network architecture, Gradient-Based Learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional Neural Networks, that are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation, recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called Graph Transformer Networks (GTN), allows such multi-module systems to be trained globally using Gradient-Based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for on-line handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility ofGraph Transformer Networks. A Graph Transformer Network for reading bank check is also described. It uses Convolutional Neural Network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provides record accuracy on business and personal checks.

A newer paradigm based on machine learning has superseded the previous approach. Within this paradigm, a general inductive process automatically builds a classifier by “learning”, from a set of previously classified documents, the characteristics of one or more categories; the advantages are a very good effectiveness, a considerable savings in terms of expert manpower, and domain independence.

Here, we develop a dynamical model of saccadic selection that accurately predicts the distribution of gaze positions as well as spatial clustering along individual scanpaths.

We tested whether human observers make use of power spectral differences between image categories when detecting animals in natural scenes. In Experiments 1 and 2 we found performance to be essentially independent of the power spectrum. Computational analysis revealed that the ease of classification correlates with the proposed spectral cue without being caused by it. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that in commercial stock photo databases a majority of animal images are pre-segmented from the background by the photographers and this pre-segmentation causes the power spectral differences between image categories and may, furthermore, help rapid animal detection. Data from a third experiment are consistent with this hypothesis. Together, our results make it exceedingly unlikely that human observers make use of power spectral differences between animal-and no-animal images during rapid animal detection.

He found that the temporal two-interval forced-choice method (2-IFC) combined with feedback, blocked constant stimulus presentation with few different stimulus intensities, and highly trained observers resulted in the “best” threshold estimates. This recommendation is in current practice in many psychophysical laboratories and has entered the psychophysicists'“folk wisdom” of how to run proper psychophysical experiments. However, Blackwell's recommendations explicitly require experienced observers, whereas many psychophysical studies, particularly with children or within a clinical setting, are performed with naïve observers. In a series of psychophysical experiments, we find a striking and consistent discrepancy between naïve observers' behavior and that reported for experienced observers by Blackwell: Naïve observers show the “best” threshold estimates for the spatial four-alternative forced-choice method (4-AFC) and the worst for the commonly employed temporal 2-IFC. We repeated our study with a highly experienced psychophysical observer, and he replicated Blackwell's findings exactly, thus suggesting that it is indeed the difference in psychophysical experience that causes the discrepancy between our findings and those of Blackwell. In addition, we explore the efficiency of different methods and show 4-AFC to be more than 3.5 times more efficient than 2-IFC under realistic conditions.

The resulting model, a one-layer feed-forward network, is surprisingly simple compared to previously suggested models which assume much more complex computations such as multi-scale processing and multiple feature channels.

In estimating these response probabilities, most studies assume stationary observers: Responses are expected to be dependent only on the intensity of a presented stimulus and not on other factors such as stimulus sequence, duration of the experiment, or the responses on previous trials. Unfortunately, a number of factors such as learning, fatigue, or fluctuations in attention and motivation will typically result in violations of this assumption. The severity of these violations is yet unknown. We use Monte Carlo simulations to show that violations of these assumptions can result in underestimation of confidence intervals for parameters of the psychometric function.

Most existing computational models use a set of biologically plausible linear filters, eg, Gabor or Difference-of-Gaussians filters as a front-end, the outputs of which are nonlinearly combined into a real number that indicates visual saliency. Unfortunately, this requires many design parameters such as the number, type, and size of the front-end filters, as well as the choice of nonlinearities, weighting and normalization schemes etc., for which biological plausibility cannot always be justified. As a result, these parameters have to be chosen in a more or less ad hoc way. Here, we propose to learn a visual saliency model directly from human eye movement data. The model is rather simplistic and essentially parameter-free, and therefore contrasts recent developments in the field that usually aim at higher prediction rates at the cost of additional parameters and increasing model complexity. Experimental results show that—despite the lack of any biological prior knowledge—our model performs comparably to existing approaches, and in fact learns image features that resemble findings from several previous studies.

Opinion mining is a kind of intent mining where the attitude is a positive or negative opinion. Most systems tackle the problem with a two step approach, an information retrieval followed by a postprocess or filter phase to identify opinionated blogs. We explored a single stage approach to opinion mining, retrieving opinionated documents ranked with a special ranking function which exploits an index enriched with opinion tags. A set of subjective words are used as tags for identifying opinionated sentences. Subjective words are marked as “opinionated” and are used in the retrieval phase to boost the rank of documents containing them. In indexing the collection, we recovered the relevant content from the blog permalink pages, exploiting HTML metadata about the generator and heuristics to remove irrelevant parts from the body.

Recent studies suggest that state-of-the-art convolutional ‘deep’ neural networks (DNNs) capture important aspects of human object perception. We hypothesized that these successes might be partially related to a human-like representation of object shape. Here we demonstrate that sensitivity for shape features, characteristic to human and primate vision, emerges in DNNs when trained for generic object recognition from natural photographs. We show that these models explain human shape judgments for several benchmark behavioral and neural stimulus sets on which earlier models mostly failed. In particular, although never explicitly trained for such stimuli, DNNs develop acute sensitivity to minute variations in shape and to non-accidental properties that have long been implicated to form the basis for object recognition. Even more strikingly, when tested with a challenging stimulus set in which shape and category membership are dissociated, the most complex model architectures capture human shape sensitivity as well as some aspects of the category structure that emerges from human judgments. As a whole, these results indicate that convolutional neural networks not only learn physically correct representations of object categories but also develop perceptually accurate representational spaces of shapes.

We begin by quantifying users' propensity to issue own-name vanity queries and geographically revealing queries. We show that these propensities interact badly with two forms of vulnerabilities in the bundling scheme. First, structural vulnerabilities arise due to properties of the heavy tail of the user search frequency distribution, or the distribution of locations that appear within a user's queries. These heavy tails may cause a user to appear visibly different from other users in the same bundle. Second, we demonstrate analytical vulnerabilities based on the ability to separate the queries in a bundle into threads …", "引用总数": "被引用次数：46"}, "url": "https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1458195", "title": "Vanity fair: privacy in querylog bundles"}

While there has been extensive prior work looking into predicting popularity of social-media content, the effect of wording per se has rarely been studied since it is often confounded with the popularity of the author and the topic. To control for these confounding factors, we take advantage of the surprising fact that there are many pairs of tweets containing the same url and written by the same user but employing different wording. Given such pairs, we ask: which version attracts more retweets? This turns out to be a more difficult task than predicting popular topics.

We compare several such nearest-neighbor approaches on a word sense disambiguation task and find that as a whole, their performance is far superior to that of standard methods.

The decomposition, known as the MAXQ decomposition, has both a procedural semantics---as a subroutine hierarchy---and a declarative semantics---as a representation of the value function of a hierarchical policy. MAXQ unifies and extends previous work on hierarchical reinforcement learning by Singh, Kaelbling, and Dayan and Hinton. It is based on the assumption that the programmer can identify useful subgoals and define subtasks that achieve these subgoals. By defining such subgoals, the programmer constrains the set of policies that need to be considered during reinforcement learning. The MAXQ value function decomposition can represent the value function of any policy that is consistent with the given hierarchy. The decomposition also creates opportunities to exploit state abstractions, so that individual MDPs within the hierarchy can ignore large parts of the state space. This is important for the practical application of the method. This paper defines the MAXQ hierarchy, proves formal results on its representational power, and establishes five conditions for the safe use of state abstractions. The paper presents an online model-free learning algorithm, MAXQ-Q, and proves that it converges with probability 1 to a kind of locally-optimal policy known as a recursively optimal policy, even in the presence of the five kinds of state abstraction …", "引用总数": "被引用次数：1291"}, "url": "https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/10266", "title": "Hierarchical reinforcement learning with the MAXQ value function decomposition"}

Thedefinition is acquired by studying collections of training examples ofthe form [x_i, f (x_i)]. Existing approaches tomulticlass learning problems include direct application of multiclassalgorithms such as the decision-tree algorithms C4. 5 and CART, application of binary concept learning algorithms to learn individualbinary functions for each of the k classes, and application ofbinary concept learning algorithms with distributed outputrepresentations. This paper compares these three approaches to a newtechnique in which error-correcting codes are employed as adistributed output representation. We show that these outputrepresentations improve the generalization performance of both C4. 5and backpropagation on a wide range of multiclass learning tasks. Wealso demonstrate that this approach is robust with respect to changesin the size of the training sample, the assignment of distributedrepresentations to particular classes, and the application ofoverfitting avoidance techniques such as decision-tree pruning. Finally, we show that---like the other methods---the error-correctingcode technique can provide reliable class probability estimates.

In this paper we propose a principled method for making an arbitrary classier cost-sensitive by wrapping a cost-minimizing procedure around it. This procedure, called MetaCost, treats the underlying classi er as a black box, requiring no knowledge of its functioning or change to it. Unlike strati cation, Meta-Cost is applicable to any number of classes and to arbitrary cost matrices. Empirical trials on a large suite of benchmark databases show that MetaCost almost always produces large cost reductions compared to the cost-blind classi er used (C4. 5RULES) and to two forms of strati cation. Further tests identify the key components of MetaCost and those that can be varied without substantial loss. Experiments on a larger database indicate that MetaCost scales well.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：1525"}, "url": "https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/450d/e42631091ad7c46cc7c37e70a28dabe63b8b.pdf", "title": "Metacost: A general method for making classifiers cost-sensitive"}

When learned topics are coherent and interpretable, they can be valuable for faceted browsing, results set diversity analysis, and document retrieval. However, when dealing with small collections or noisy text (eg web search result snippets or blog posts), learned topics can be less coherent, less interpretable, and less useful.

Results In our method, raw qPCR data are represented as molecule counts, and described using generalized linear mixed models under Poisson-lognormal error. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is used to sample from the joint posterior distribution over all model parameters, thereby estimating the effects of all experimental factors on the expression of every gene. The Poisson-based model allows for the correct specification of the mean-variance relationship of the PCR amplification process, and can also glean information from instances of no amplification (zero counts). Our method is very flexible with respect to control genes: any prior knowledge about the expected degree of their stability can be directly incorporated into the model.

The first algorithm is a straightforward mapping of LDA to a distributed processor setting. In this algorithm processors concurrently perform Gibbs sampling over local data followed by a global update of topic counts. The algorithm is simple to implement and can be viewed as an approximation to Gibbs-sampled LDA. The second version is a model that uses a hierarchical Bayesian extension of LDA to directly account for distributed data. This model has a theoretical guarantee of convergence but is more complex to implement than the first algorithm. Our distributed algorithm for HDP takes the straightforward mapping approach, and merges newly-created topics either by matching or by topic-id.

We propose two distributed inference schemes that are motivated from different perspectives. The first scheme uses local Gibbs sampling on each processor with periodic updates—it is simple to implement and can be viewed as an approximation to a single processor implementation of Gibbs sampling. The second scheme relies on a hierarchical Bayesian extension of the standard LDA model to directly account for the fact that data are distributed across в processors—it has a theoretical guarantee of convergence but is more complex to implement than the approximate method. Using five real-world text corpora we show that distributed learning works very well for LDA models, ie, perplexity and precision-recall scores for distributed learning are indistinguishable from those obtained with single-processor learning.

In order to accommodate data typically encountered in practice it is necessary to deal effectively with enumerated attributes and with missing values, and techniques devised by Breiman et al.

First they induce an initial rule set and then they refine it using a rather complex optimization stage that discards (C4.5) or adjusts (RIPPER) individual rules to make them work better together. In contrast, this paper shows how good rule sets can be learned one rule at a time, without any need for global optimization. We present an algorithm for inferring rules by repeatedly generating partial decision trees, thus combining the two major paradigms for rule generation-creating rules from decision trees and the separate-and-conquer rule-learning technique. The algorithm is straightforward and elegant: despite this, experiments on standard datasets show that it produces rule sets that are as accurate as and of similar size to those generated by C4.5, and more accurate than RIPPER’s. Moreover, it operates efficiently, and because it avoids postprocessing, does not suffer the extremely slow performance on pathological example sets for which the C4.5 method has been criticized.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：1349"}, "url": "https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/handle/10289/1047", "title": "Generating accurate rule sets without global optimization"}

Adaptive coding allows the model to be constructed dynamically by both encoder and decoder during the course of the transmission, and has been shown to incur a smaller coding overhead than explicit transmission of the model's statistics. But there is a basic conflict between the desire to use high-order Markov models and the need to have them formed quickly as the initial part of the message is sent. This paper describes how the conflict can be resolved with partial string matching, and reports experimental results which show that mixed-case English text can be coded in as little as 2.2 bits/ character with no prior knowledge of the source.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：1401"}, "url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1096090/", "title": "Data compression using adaptive coding and partial string matching"}

It represents information at least as compactly-sometimes considerably more so. Its performance is optimal without the need for blocking of input data. It encourages a clear separation between the model for representing data and the encoding of information with respect to that model. It accommodates adaptive models easily and is computationally efficient. Yet many authors and practitioners seem unaware of the technique. Indeed there is a widespread belief that Huffman coding cannot be improved upon. We aim to rectify this situation by presenting an accessible implementation of arithmetic coding and by detailing its performance characteristics. We start by briefly reviewing basic concepts of data compression and introducing the model-based approach that underlies most modern techniques. We then outline the idea of arithmetic coding using a simple example, before presenting programs for both encoding and decoding. In these programs the model occupies a separate module so that different models can easily be used. Next we discuss the construction of fixed and adaptive models and detail the compression efficiency and execution time of the programs, including the effect of different arithmetic word lengths on compression efficiency. Finally, we outline a few applications where arithmetic coding is appropriate.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：3679"}, "url": "https://ftp.cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/csc310-2006/extras/p520-witten.pdf", "title": "Arithmetic coding for data compression"}

However, classical validation does not support the user in better understanding the properties of the model or the underlying data. Even though, a number of visualization tools for analyzing (Q)SAR information in small molecule datasets exist, integrated visualization methods that allow the investigation of model validation results are still lacking. We propose visual validation, as an approach for the graphical inspection of (Q)SAR model validation results. The approach applies the 3D viewer CheS-Mapper, an open-source application for the exploration of small molecules in virtual 3D space. The present work describes the new functionalities in CheS-Mapper 2.0, that facilitate the analysis of (Q)SAR information and allows the visual validation of (Q)SAR models. The tool enables the comparison of model predictions to the actual activity in feature space. The approach is generic: It is model-independent and can handle physico-chemical and structural input features as well as quantitative and qualitative endpoints. Visual validation with CheS-Mapper enables analyzing (Q)SAR information in the data and indicates how this information is employed by the (Q)SAR model. It reveals, if the endpoint is modeled too specific or too generic and highlights common properties of misclassified compounds. Moreover, the researcher can use CheS-Mapper to inspect how the (Q)SAR model predicts activity cliffs.

Classical dynamic programming approaches require the explicit state enumeration in the reward model. This is often impractical: the number of states grows very quickly with the number of domain objects and relations among these objects. Relational sequence alignment aims at exploiting symbolic structure to avoid the full enumeration. This comes at the expense of a more complex reward model selection problem: virtually infinitely many abstraction levels have to be explored. In this paper, we apply gradient-based boosting to leverage this problem. Specifically, we show how to reduce the learning problem to a series of relational regressions problems.

First a standard method is run, then HI learns rules which are true for sequences of high similarity to the target (assumed homologues) and not true for general sequences, these rules are then used to discriminate sequences in the twilight zone. To learn the rules HI describes the sequences in a novel way based on a bioinformatic knowledge base, and the machine learning method of inductive logic programming. To evaluate HI we used the PDB40D benchmark which lists sequences of known homology but low sequence similarity. We compared the HI methodoly with PSI-BLAST alone and found HI performed significantly better. In addition, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that these improvements were robust for all reasonable error costs. The predictive homology rules learnt by HI by can be interpreted biologically to provide insight into conserved features of homologous protein families.

These rules predict 65% of the ORFs with no assigned function in M. tuberculosis and 24% of those in E. coli, with an estimated accuracy of 60–80% (depending on the level of functional assignment).

With the increased possibilities in modern society for companies and institutions to gather data cheaply and efficiently, this subject has become of increasing importance. This interest has inspired a rapidly maturing research field with developments both on a theoretical, as well as on a practical level with the availability of a range of commercial tools. Unfortunately, the widespread application of this technology has been limited by an important assumption in mainstream Data Mining approaches. This assumption–all data resides, or can be made to reside, in a single table–prevents the use of these Data Mining tools in certain important domains, or requires considerable massaging and altering of the data as a pre-processing step. This limitation has spawned a relatively recent interest in richer Data Mining paradigms that do allow structured data as opposed to the traditional flat representation. Over the last decade, we have seen the emergence of Data Mining techniques that cater to the analysis of structured data. These techniques are typically upgrades from well-known and accepted Data Mining techniques for tabular data, and focus on dealing with the richer representational setting. Within these techniques, which we will collectively refer to as Structured Data Mining techniques, we can identify a number of paradigms or ‘traditions’, each of which is inspired by an existing and well-known choice for representing and manipulating structured data.

It is still a challenge, however, to develop methods that assign biological functions to the ORFs in these genomes automatically. Different machine learning methods have been proposed to this end, but it remains unclear which method is to be preferred in terms of predictive performance, efficiency and usability. We study the use of decision tree based models for predicting the multiple functions of ORFs. First, we describe an algorithm for learning hierarchical multi-label decision trees. These can simultaneously predict all the functions of an ORF, while respecting a given hierarchy of gene functions (such as FunCat or GO). We present new results obtained with this algorithm, showing that the trees found by it exhibit clearly better predictive performance than the trees found by previously described methods. Nevertheless, the predictive performance of individual trees is lower than that of some recently proposed statistical learning methods. We show that ensembles of such trees are more accurate than single trees and are competitive with state-of-the-art statistical learning and functional linkage methods. Moreover, the ensemble method is computationally efficient and easy to use. Our results suggest that decision tree based methods are a state-of-the-art, efficient and easy-to-use approach to ORF function prediction.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：144"}, "url": "https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-11-2", "title": "Predicting gene function using hierarchical multi-label decision tree ensembles"}

We discuss how existing decision tree algorithms can be adapted to this aim, and provide an analysis of the speedups these adaptations may yield. We identify a number of parameters that influence the obtainable speedups, and validate and refine our analysis with experiments on a variety of data sets with two different implementations.

This paper describes a fast, correlation-based filter algorithm that can be applied to continuous and discrete problems.

This problem occurs whenever an estimate cannot be obtained from held-out training data; for instance, when data that have been used to train the model are held back for reasons of privacy or do not reflect the test distribution. In this case, new test instances have to be drawn and labeled at a cost. An active estimation procedure selects instances according to an instrumental sampling distribution. An analysis of the sources of estimation error leads to an optimal sampling distribution that minimizes estimator variance. We explore conditions under which active estimates of F-measures are more accurate than estimates based on instances sampled from the test distribution.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：12"}, "url": "http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3999-active-estimation-of-f-measures", "title": "Active estimation of f-measures"}

Models are constructed by incrementally refining and regularizing the structure of a simple generative model for genotype data under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The proposed method is evaluated on real-world and simulated population data. Results show that it is competitive with other recently proposed methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy, while offering a particularly good trade-off between computational costs and quality of results for large datasets.

The 3-D CNN representation is trained on video action recognition tasks, so as to produce a representation that is tuned to human motion and behavior. Second we propose a temporal attention mechanism that allows to go beyond local temporal modeling and learns to automatically select the most relevant temporal segments given the text-generating RNN.

Unfortunately, conducting the theoretical analysis asynchronous methods is difficult, notably due to the introduction of delay and inconsistency in inherently sequential algorithms. Handling these issues often requires resorting to simplifying but unrealistic assumptions. Through a novel perspective, we revisit and clarify a subtle but important technical issue present in a large fraction of the recent convergence rate proofs for asynchronous parallel optimization algorithms, and propose a simplification of the recently introduced “perturbed iterate” framework that resolves it. We demonstrate the usefulness of our new framework by analyzing three distinct asynchronous parallel incremental optimization algorithms: Hogwild (asynchronous Sgd), Kromagnon (asynchronous Svrg) and Asaga, a novel asynchronous parallel version of the incremental gradient algorithm Saga that enjoys fast linear convergence rates. We are able to both remove problematic assumptions and obtain better theoretical results. Notably, we prove that Asaga and Kromagnon can obtain a theoretical linear speedup on multi-core systems even without sparsity assumptions. We present results of an implementation on a 40-core architecture illustrating the practical speedups as well as the hardware overhead.

A key property that allows to study the statistical implications of such approximations is that of Fisher consistency. Fisher consistency is a desirable property for surrogate loss functions and implies that in the population setting, ie, if the probability distribution that generates the data were available, then optimization of the surrogate would yield the best possible model. In this paper we will characterize the Fisher consistency of a rich family of surrogate loss functions used in the context of ordinal regression, including support vector ordinal regression, ORBoosting and least absolute deviation. We will see that, for a family of surrogate loss functions that subsumes support vector ordinal regression and ORBoosting, consistency can be fully characterized by the derivative of a real-valued function at zero, as happens for convex margin-based surrogates in binary classification. We also derive excess risk bounds for a surrogate of the absolute error that generalize existing risk bounds for binary classification. Finally, our analysis suggests a novel surrogate of the squared error loss. We compare this novel surrogate with competing approaches on 9 different datasets. Our method shows to be highly competitive in practice, outperforming the least squares loss on 7 out of 9 datasets.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：12"}, "url": "http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume18/15-495/15-495.pdf", "title": "On the consistency of ordinal regression methods"}

Nowadays, modern imaging techniques such as fMRI are revealing several aspects of the human brain with progressively high spatio-temporal resolution. However, in order to answer increasingly complex neuroscientific questions the technical improvements in acquisition must be matched with novel data analysis methods. In this thesis we examine different applications of machine learning to the processing of fMRI data. We propose novel extensions and investigate the theoretical properties of different models. % The goal of an fMRI experiments is to answer a neuroscientific question. However, it is usually not possible to perform hypothesis testing directly on the data output by the fMRI scanner. Instead, fMRI data enters a processing pipeline in which it suffers several transformations before conclusions are drawn. Often the data acquired through the fMRI scanner follows a feature extraction step in which time-independent activation coefficients are extracted from the fMRI signal. The first contribution of this thesis is the introduction a model named Rank-1 GLM (R1-GLM) for the joint estimation of time-independent activation coefficients and the hemodynamic response function (HRF). We quantify the improvement of this approach with respect to existing procedures on different fMRI datasets.

This suggests that a data-driven estimation of this function could lead to more statistical power when modeling BOLD fMRI data. However, unconstrained estimation of the HRF can yield highly unstable results when the number of free parameters is large. We develop a method for the joint estimation of activation and HRF by means of a rank constraint, forcing the estimated HRF to be equal across events or experimental conditions, yet permitting it to differ across voxels. Model estimation leads to an optimization problem that we propose to solve with an efficient quasi-Newton method, exploiting fast gradient computations.

An advantage of this method is that hyperparameters can be updated before model parameters have fully converged. We also give sufficient conditions for the global convergence of this method, based on regularity conditions of the involved functions and summability of errors. Finally, we validate the empirical performance of this method on the estimation of regularization constants of l2-regularized logistic regression and kernel Ridge regression.

In a plan recognition problem, one is given a fragmented description of actions performed by one or more agents, and expected to infer the overall plan or scenario which explains those actions. This thesis develops the first formal description of the plan recognition process. Beginning with a reified logic of events, the thesis presents a scheme for hierarchically structuring a library of event types. A semantic basis for non-deductive inference, called\" minimum covering entailment\", justifies the conclusions that one may draw from a set of observed actions. Minimum covering entailment is defined by delineating the class of models in which the library is complete and the set of unrelated observations is minimized. An equivalent proof theory forms a preliminary basis for mechanizing the theory. Equivalence theorems between the proof and model theories are presented. Minimum covering entailment is related to a formalism for nonmonotonic inference known as\" circumscription\". Finally, the thesis describes a number of algorithms which correctly implement the theory, together with a discussion of their complexity. The theory is applied to a number of examples of plan recognition, in domains ranging from an operating system advisor to the theory of speech acts. The thesis shows how problems of medical diagnosis, a similar kind of non-deductive reasoning, can be cast in the framework, and an example previously solved by a medical expert system is worked out in detail.

In this paper, we address both these problems. We propose a compact hypercube-based representation for the lifted network, which can greatly reduce the cost of lifted network construction. We also present two methods for approximate lifted network construction, which groups together similar but distinguishable objects and treats them as if they were identical. This can greatly reduce the size of the lifted network as well as the time required for lifted network construction, but potentially at some cost to accuracy. The coarseness of the approximation can be adjusted depending on the accuracy required, and we can bound the resulting error.

First order probabilistic models combine the power of logic and probability to deal with such domains. A naive approach to inference in these models is to propositionalize the whole theory and carry out the inference on the ground network. Lifted inference techniques (such as lifted belief propagation; Singla and Domingos 2008) provide a more scalable approach to inference by combining together groups of objects which behave identically. In many cases, constructing the lifted network can itself be quite costly. In addition, the exact lifted network is often very close in size to the fully propositionalized model. To overcome these problems, we present approximate lifted inference, which groups together similar but distinguishable objects and treats them as if they were identical. Early stopping terminates the execution of the lifted network construction at an early stage resulting in a coarser network. Noise-tolerant hypercubes allow for marginal errors in the representation of the lifted network itself. Both of our algorithms can significantly speed up the process of lifted network construction as well as result in much smaller models. The coarseness of the approximation can be adjusted depending on the accuracy required, and we can bound the resulting error.

While this area of research has gained much attention recently, most works still rely on handcrafted features. In contrast, we apply a multiscale convolutional network to learn features directly from the images and the depth information. Using a frame by frame labeling, we obtain nearly state-of-the-art performance on the NYU-v2 depth dataset with an accuracy of 64.5%. We then show that the labeling can be further improved by exploiting the temporal consistency in the video sequence of the scene. To that goal, we present a method producing temporally consistent superpixels from a streaming video. Among the different methods producing superpixel segmentations of an image, the graph-based approach of Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher is broadly employed. One of its interesting properties is that the regions are computed in a greedy manner in quasi-linear time by using a minimum spanning tree. In a framework exploiting minimum spanning trees all along, we propose an efficient video segmentation approach that computes temporally consistent pixels in a causal manner, filling the need for causal and real-time applications.

We present a novel network architecture, HashedNets, that exploits inherent redundancy in neural networks to achieve drastic reductions in model sizes. HashedNets uses a low-cost hash function to randomly group connection weights into hash buckets, and all connections within the same hash bucket share a single parameter value. These parameters are tuned to adjust to the HashedNets weight sharing architecture with standard backprop during training. Our hashing procedure introduces no additional memory overhead, and we demonstrate on several benchmark data sets that HashedNets shrink the storage requirements of neural networks substantially while mostly preserving generalization performance.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：498"}, "url": "http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/chenc15.pdf", "title": "Compressing neural networks with the hashing trick"}

More interestingly, how could an artificial vision system {em learn} appropriate internal representations automatically, the way animals and humans seem to learn by simply looking at the world ? Another related question is that of computational tractability, and more precisely that of computational efficiency. Given a good visual representation, how efficiently can it be trained, and used to encode new sensorial data. Efficiency has several dimensions: power requirements, processing speed, and memory usage.

The majority of the feature extraction systems have a common structure composed of a ﬁlter bank (generally based on oriented edge detectors or 2D Gabor functions), a nonlinear operation (quantization, winner-take-all, sparsiﬁcation, normalization, and/or pointwise saturation), and ﬁnally a pooling operation (max, average, or histogramming). For example, the scale-invariant feature transform (S IFT)(Lowe, 2004) operator applies oriented edge ﬁlters to a small patch and determines the dominant orientation through a winner-take-all operation. Finally, the resulting sparse vectors are added (pooled) over a larger patch to form a local orientation histogram. Some recognition systems use a single stage of feature extractors (Lazebnik, Schmid, and Ponce, 2006; Dalal and Triggs, 2005; Berg, Berg, and Malik, 2005; Pinto, Cox, and DiCarlo, 2008). Other models such as HMAX-type models (Serre, Wolf, and Poggio, 2005; Mutch, and Lowe, 2006) and convolutional networks use two more layers of successive feature extractors. Different training algorithms have been used for learning the parameters of convolutional networks. In LeCun et al.(1998b) and Huang and LeCun (2006), pure supervised learning is used to update the parameters.

The vast majority of recent papers on emergent communication show that adding a communication channel leads to an increase in reward or task success. This is a useful indicator, but provides only a coarse measure of the agent's learned communication abilities. As we move towards more complex environments, it becomes imperative to have a set of finer tools that allow qualitative and quantitative insights into the emergence of communication. This may be especially useful to allow humans to monitor agents' behaviour, whether for fault detection, assessing performance, or even building trust. In this paper, we examine a few intuitive existing metrics for measuring communication, and show that they can be misleading. Specifically, by training deep reinforcement learning agents to play simple matrix games augmented with a communication channel, we find a scenario where agents appear to communicate (their messages provide information about their subsequent action), and yet the messages do not impact the environment or other agent in any way. We explain this phenomenon using ablation studies and by visualizing the representations of the learned policies. We also survey some commonly used metrics for measuring emergent communication, and provide recommendations as to when these metrics should be used.", "学术搜索中的文章": "R Lowe, J Foerster, YL Boureau, J Pineau, Y Dauphin - arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.05168, 2019"}, "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05168", "title": "On the Pitfalls of Measuring Emergent Communication"}

One challenge for dialogue agents is being able to recognize feelings in the conversation partner and reply accordingly, a key communicative skill that is trivial for humans.

End-to-end dialog systems, in which all components are trained from the dialogs themselves, escape this limitation. But the encouraging success recently obtained in chit-chat dialog may not carry over to goal-oriented settings. This paper proposes a testbed to break down the strengths and shortcomings of end-to-end dialog systems in goal-oriented applications. Set in the context of restaurant reservation, our tasks require manipulating sentences and symbols, so as to properly conduct conversations, issue API calls and use the outputs of such calls. We show that an end-to-end dialog system based on Memory Networks can reach promising, yet imperfect, performance and learn to perform non-trivial operations.

Recent approaches rely on sophisticated encoding methods and more specialized codebooks (or dictionaries), e.g., learned on subsets of descriptors which are close in feature space, to circumvent this problem. In this work, we argue that a common trait found in much recent work in image recognition or retrieval is that it leverages locality in feature space on top of purely spatial locality. We propose to apply this idea in its simplest form to an object recognition system based on the spatial pyramid framework, to increase the performance of small dictionaries with very little added engineering.

Pooling is used to achieve invariance to image transformations, more compact representations, and better robustness to noise and clutter. Several papers have shown that the details of the pooling operation can greatly influence the performance, but studies have so far been purely empirical. In this paper, we show that the reasons underlying the performance of various pooling methods are obscured by several confounding factors, such as the link between the sample cardinality in a spatial pool and the resolution at which low-level features have been extracted.

This process can often be broken down into two steps:(1) a coding step, which performs a pointwise transformation of the descriptors into a representation better adapted to the task, and (2) a pooling step, which summarizes the coded features over larger neighborhoods. Several combinations of coding and pooling schemes have been proposed in the literature. The goal of this paper is threefold. We seek to establish the relative importance of each step of mid-level feature extraction through a comprehensive cross evaluation of several types of coding modules (hard and soft vector quantization, sparse coding) and pooling schemes (by taking the average, or the maximum), which obtains state-of-the-art performance or better on several recognition benchmarks. We show how to improve the best performing coding scheme by learning a supervised discriminative dictionary for sparse coding. We provide theoretical and empirical insight into the remarkable performance of max pooling.

This ambitious book is the first unified treatment of the emerging knowledge-base in Bayesian time series techniques. Exploiting the unifying framework of probabilistic graphical models, the book covers approximation schemes, both Monte Carlo and deterministic, and introduces switching, multi-object, non-parametric and agent-based models in a variety of application environments. It demonstrates that the basic framework supports the rapid creation of models tailored to specific applications and gives insight into the computational complexity of their implementation. The authors span traditional disciplines such as statistics and engineering and the more recently established areas of machine learning and pattern recognition.

We use a supervised learning paradigm to derive a synaptic update rule that optimizes by gradient ascent the likelihood of postsynaptic firing at one or several desired firing times. We find that the optimal strategy of up- and downregulating synaptic efficacies depends on the relative timing between presynaptic spike arrival and desired postsynaptic firing. If the presynaptic spike arrives before the desired postsynaptic spike timing, our optimal learning rule predicts that the synapse should become potentiated. The dependence of the potentiation on spike timing directly reflects the time course of an excitatory postsynaptic potential. However, our approach gives no unique reason for synaptic depression under reversed spike timing.

We first discuss the geometry of feature space. In particular, we review what is known about the shape of the image of input space under the feature space map, and how this influences the capacity of SV methods. Following this, we describe how the metric governing the intrinsic geometry of the mapped surface can be computed in terms of the kernel, using the example of the class of inhomogeneous polynomial kernels, which are often used in SV pattern recognition. We then discuss the connection between feature space and input space by dealing with the question of how one can, given some vector in feature space, find a preimage (exact or approximate) in input space. We describe algorithms to tackle this issue, and show their utility in two applications of kernel methods.

For graph data, a whole toolbox of data mining algorithms becomes available by defining a kernel function on instances of graphs.

We try to overcome this problem by defining expressive graph kernels which are based on paths. As the computation of all paths and longest paths in a graph is NP-hard, we propose graph kernels based on shortest paths.

We find a spectral decomposition approach even more efficient when computing entire kernel matrices. For labeled graphs we develop conjugate gradient and fixed-point methods that take O (dn 3) time per iteration, where d is the size of the label set. By extending the necessary linear algebra to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) we obtain the same result for d-dimensional edge kernels, and O (n 4) in the infinite-dimensional case; on sparse graphs these algorithms only take O (n 2) time per iteration in all cases.

Learning the joint distribution of image regions and words has many applications. We consider in detail predicting words associated with whole images (auto-annotation) and corresponding to particular image regions (region naming). Auto-annotation might help organize and access large collections of images. Region naming is a model of object recognition as a process of translating image regions to words, much as one might translate from one language to another. Learning the relationships between image regions and semantic correlates (words) is an interesting example of multi-modal data mining, particularly because it is typically hard to apply data mining techniques to collections of images. We develop a number of models for the joint distribution of image regions and words, including several which explicitly learn the correspondence between regions and words. We study multi-modal and correspondence extensions to Hofmann's hierarchical clustering/aspect model, a translation model adapted from statistical machine translation (Brown et al.), and a multi-modal extension to mixture of latent Dirichlet allocation (MoM-LDA). All models are assessed using a large collection of annotated images of real scenes. We study in depth the difficult problem of measuring performance.

There has been substantial progress in these different communities and surprising convergence has developed between the formalisms. The awareness of this convergence and the growing interest of researchers in understanding the essential unity of the subject underlies the current volume. Two research communities which have used graphical or network formalisms to particular advantage are the belief network community and the neural network community. Belief networks arose within computer science and statistics and were developed with an emphasis on prior knowledge and exact probabilistic calculations. Neural networks arose within electrical engineering, physics and neuroscience and have emphasised pattern recognition and systems modelling problems. This volume draws together researchers from these two communities and presents both kinds of networks as instances of a general unified graphical formalism. The book focuses on probabilistic methods for learning and inference in graphical models, algorithm analysis and design, theory and applications.

The embedding is performed implicitly, by specifying the inner products between each pair of points in the embedding space. This information is contained in the so-called kernel matrix, a symmetric and positive semidefinite matrix that encodes the relative positions of all points. Specifying this matrix amounts to specifying the geometry of the embedding space and inducing a notion of similarity in the input space---classical model selection problems in machine learning. In this paper we show how the kernel matrix can be learned from data via semidefinite programming (SDP) techniques. When applied to a kernel matrix associated with both training and test data this gives a powerful transductive algorithm---using the labeled part of the data one can learn an embedding also for the unlabeled part. The similarity between test points is inferred from training points and their labels. Importantly, these learning problems are convex, so we obtain a method for learning both the model class and the function without local minima. Furthermore, this approach leads directly to a convex method for learning the 2-norm soft margin parameter in support vector machines, solving an important open problem.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：2549"}, "url": "http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v5/lanckriet04a.html", "title": "Learning the kernel matrix with semidefinite programming"}

It is known that dendritic integration of excitatory and inhibitory synapses can be highly nonlinear in reality and can heavily depend on the exact location and spatial arrangement of inhibitory and excitatory synapses on the dendrite. Despite this known fact, most neuron models used in artificial neural networks today still only describe the voltage potential of a single somatic compartment and assume a simple linear summation of all individual synaptic inputs. We here suggest a new biophysical motivated derivation of a single compartment model that integrates the nonlinear effects of shunting inhibition, where an inhibitory input on the route of an excitatory input to the soma cancels or ``shunts'' the excitatory potential. In particular, our integration of nonlinear dendritic processing into the neuron model follows a simple multiplicative rule, suggested recently by experiments, and allows for strict mathematical treatment of network effects. Using our new formulation, we further devised a spiking network model where inhibitory neurons act as global shunting gates, and show that the network exhibits persistent activity in a low firing regime.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：16"}, "url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2013.00056", "title": "Nonlinear multiplicative dendritic integration in neuron and network models"}

The key challenge is to trade off exploration by gathering data for estimating the mean payoff function over the context-action space, and to exploit by choosing an action deemed optimal based on the gathered data. We model the payoff function as a sample from a Gaussian process defined over the joint context-action space, and develop CGP-UCB, an intuitive upper-confidence style algorithm. We show that by mixing and matching kernels for contexts and actions, CGP-UCB can handle a variety of practical applications. We further provide generic tools for deriving regret bounds when using such composite kernel functions.

The practicality of current classifiers, however, is restricted by two major challenges. First, due to the high data dimensionality and low sample size, algorithms struggle to separate informative from uninformative features, resulting in poor generalization performance. Second, popular discriminative methods such as support vector machines (SVMs) rarely afford mechanistic interpretability. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing a novel generative-embedding approach that incorporates neurobiologically interpretable generative models into discriminative classifiers. Our approach extends previous work on trial-by-trial classification for electrophysiological recordings to subject-by-subject classification for fMRI and offers two key advantages over conventional methods: it may provide more accurate predictions by exploiting discriminative information encoded in ‘hidden’ physiological quantities such as synaptic connection strengths; and it affords mechanistic interpretability of clinical classifications. Here, we introduce generative embedding for fMRI using a combination of dynamic causal models (DCMs) and SVMs. We propose a general procedure of DCM-based generative embedding for subject-wise classification, provide a concrete implementation, and suggest good-practice guidelines for unbiased application of generative embedding in the context of fMRI.

Putting all these data in simple-to-use databases is a first step; but realizing the full potential of the data requires algorithms that automatically extract regularities from the data, which can then lead to biological insight. Many of the problems in computational biology are in the form of prediction: starting from prediction of a gene’s structure, prediction of its function, interactions, and role in disease. Support vector machines (SVMs) and related kernel methods are extremely good at solving such problems [1–3]. SVMs are widely used in computational biology due to their high accuracy, their ability to deal with high-dimensional and large datasets, and their flexibility in modeling diverse sources of data [2, 4–6]. The simplest form of a prediction problem is binary classification: trying to discriminate between objects that belong to one of two categories—positive (+ 1) or negative (21). SVMs use two key concepts to solve this problem: large margin separation and kernel functions. The idea of large margin separation can be motivated by classification of points in two dimensions (see Figure 1). A simple way to classify the points is to draw a straight line and call points lying on one side positive and on the other side negative. If the two sets are well separated, one would intuitively draw the separating line such that it is as far as possible away from the points in both sets (see Figures 2 and 3).

For instance, data can often be clustered in many “plausible” ways, and if a clustering algorithm such as K-means initially fails to find one that is meaningful to a user, the only recourse may be for the user to manually tweak the metric until sufficiently good clusters are found. For these and other applications requiring good metrics, it is desirable that we provide a more systematic way for users to indicate what they consider “similar.” For instance, we may ask them to provide examples. In this paper, we present an algorithm that, given examples of similar (and, if desired, dissimilar) pairs of points in вдг, learns a distance metric over вег that respects these relationships. Our method is based on posing metric learning as a convex optimization problem, which allows us to give efficient, local-optima-free algorithms.

However, even when MFVB provides accurate posterior means for certain parameters, it often mis-estimates variances and covariances. Furthermore, prior robustness measures have remained undeveloped for MFVB. By deriving a simple formula for the effect of infinitesimal model perturbations on MFVB posterior means, we provide both improved covariance estimates and local robustness measures for MFVB, thus greatly expanding the practical usefulness of MFVB posterior approximations. The estimates for MFVB posterior covariances rely on a result from the classical Bayesian robustness literature that relates derivatives of posterior expectations to posterior covariances and includes the Laplace approximation as a special case. Our key condition is that the MFVB approximation provides good estimates of a select subset of posterior means—an assumption that has been shown to hold in many practical settings.

We present a single-switch selection method, “Nomon,” that is general and efficient. Existing single-switch selection methods require selectable options to be arranged in ways that limit potential applications. By contrast, traditional operating systems, web browsers, and free-form applications (such as drawing) place options at arbitrary points on the screen. Nomon, however, has the flexibility to select any point on a screen. Nomon adapts automatically to an individual's clicking ability; it allows a person who clicks precisely to make a selection quickly and allows a person who clicks imprecisely more time to make a selection without error. Nomon reaps gains in information rate by allowing the specification of beliefs (priors) about option selection probabilities and by avoiding tree-based selection schemes in favor of direct (posterior) inference. We have developed both a Nomon-based writing application and a drawing application. To evaluate Nomon's performance, we compared the writing application with a popular existing method for single-switch writing (row-column scanning). Novice users wrote 35% faster with the Nomon interface than with the scanning interface.

For practical reasons, the family of distributions in VI is usually constrained so that it does not include the exact posterior, even as a limit point. Thus, no matter how long VI is run, the resulting approximation will not approach the exact posterior. We propose to instead consider a more flexible approximating family consisting of all possible finite mixtures of a parametric base distribution (eg, Gaussian). For efficient inference, we borrow ideas from gradient boosting to develop an algorithm we call boosting variational inference (BVI). BVI iteratively improves the current approximation by mixing it with a new component from the base distribution family and thereby yields progressively more accurate posterior approximations as more computing time is spent. Unlike a number of common VI variants including mean-field VI, BVI is able to capture multimodality, general posterior covariance, and nonstandard posterior shapes.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：23"}, "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05559", "title": "Boosting variational inference"}

We present an alternative notion of exchangeability for random graphs, which we call edge exchangeability, in which the distribution of a graph sequence is invariant to the order of the edges. We demonstrate that edge-exchangeable models, unlike models that are traditionally vertex exchangeable, can exhibit sparsity. To do so, we outline a general framework for graph generative models; by contrast to the pioneering work of Caron and Fox (2015), models within our framework are stationary across steps of the graph sequence. In particular, our model grows the graph by instantiating more latent atoms of a single random measure as the dataset size increases, rather than adding new atoms to the measure.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：24"}, "url": "http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6586-edge-exchangeable-graphs-and-sparsity", "title": "Edge-exchangeable graphs and sparsity"}

Standard Bayesian inference algorithms are computationally expensive, however, making their direct application to large datasets difficult or infeasible. Recent work on scaling Bayesian inference has focused on modifying the underlying algorithms to, for example, use only a random data subsample at each iteration. We leverage the insight that data is often redundant to instead obtain a weighted subset of the data (called a coreset) that is much smaller than the original dataset. We can then use this small coreset in any number of existing posterior inference algorithms without modification. In this paper, we develop an efficient coreset construction algorithm for Bayesian logistic regression models. We provide theoretical guarantees on the size and approximation quality of the coreset--both for fixed, known datasets, and in expectation for a wide class of data generative models. Crucially, the proposed approach also permits efficient construction of the coreset in both streaming and parallel settings, with minimal additional effort. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a number of synthetic and real-world datasets, and find that, in practice, the size of the coreset is independent of the original dataset size. Furthermore, constructing the coreset takes a negligible amount of time compared to that required to run MCMC on it.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：44"}, "url": "http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6485-coresets-for-scalable-bayesian-logistic-regression", "title": "Coresets for scalable bayesian logistic regression"}

This problem sits at the intersection of statistical physics and machine learning, and we suggest that more efficient solutions are possible by merging ideas from the two fields.

To illustrate, we apply our framework to the feature learning setting, where the beta process and Indian buffet process provide an appropriate Bayesian nonparametric prior.

For instance, classifiers are often trained and tested on trial-wise measurements, separately for each subject within a group. One important question is how classification outcomes observed in individual subjects can be generalized to the population from which the group was sampled. To address this question, this paper introduces novel statistical models that are guided by three desiderata. First, all models explicitly respect the hierarchical nature of the data, that is, they are mixed-effects models that simultaneously account for within-subjects (fixed-effects) and across-subjects (random-effects) variance components. Second, maximum-likelihood estimation is replaced by full Bayesian inference in order to enable natural regularization of the estimation problem and to afford conclusions in terms of posterior probability statements. Third, inference on classification accuracy is complemented by inference on the balanced accuracy, which avoids inflated accuracy estimates for imbalanced data sets. We introduce hierarchical models that satisfy these criteria and demonstrate their advantages over conventional methods using MCMC implementations for model inversion and model selection on both synthetic and empirical data. We envisage that our approach will improve the sensitivity and validity of statistical inference in future hierarchical classification studies.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：20"}, "url": "http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v13/brodersen12a.html", "title": "Bayesian mixed-effects inference on classification performance in hierarchical data sets"}

We consider regression models in combination with variable selection and variable aggregation embedded in a double-layered cross-validation loop. Moreover, bootstrapping is employed to identify the importance of explanatory variables. Critically, the data is not confounded by an admission-induced selection bias, which allows us to obtain an unbiased estimate of the predictive value of undergraduatelevel indicators for subsequent performance at the graduate level.

These inferences are necessarily uncertain. Here, we illustrate how the hierarchical Gaussian filter (HGF) offers a principled and generic way to deal with the several forms that uncertainty in perception takes. The HGF is a recent derivation of one-step update equations from Bayesian principles that rests on a hierarchical generative model of the environment and its (in)stability. It is computationally highly efficient, allows for online estimates of hidden states, and has found numerous applications to experimental data from human subjects. In this paper, we generalize previous descriptions of the HGF and its account of perceptual uncertainty. First, we explicitly formulate the extension of the HGF’s hierarchy to any number of levels; second, we discuss how various forms of uncertainty are accommodated by the minimization of variational free energy as encoded in the update equations; third, we combine the HGF with decision models and demonstrate the inversion of this combination; finally, we report a simulation study that compared four optimization methods for inverting the HGF/decision model combination at different noise levels.

Our approach is to develop a trainable information extraction system that takes two inputs. The first is an ontology that defines the classes (eg, Company, Person, Employee, Product) and relations (eg, Employed. By, Produced. By) of interest when creating the knowledge base. The second is a set of training data consisting of labeled regions of hypertext that represent instances of these classes and relations. Given these inputs, the system learns to extract information from other pages and hyperlinks on the Web.

We assume that either view of the example would be sufficient for learning if we had enough labeled data, but our goal is to use both views together to allow inexpensive unlabeled data to augment, a much smaller set of labeled examples. Specifically, the presence of two distinct views of each example suggests strategies in which two learning algorithms are trained separately on each view, and then each algorithm’s predictions on new unlabeled examples are used to enlarge the training set of the other.

There are two main goals in decoding Showing that the variable of interest can be predicted from the data in a statistically reliable manner (ie there's enough information present). Shedding light on how the data encode the information needed to predict, taking into account what the classifier used can learn and any criteria by which the data are filtered (eg how voxels and time points used are chosen). Chapter 2 considers the issues that arise when using traditional linear classifiers and several different voxel selection techniques to strive towards these goals. It examines questions such as whether there is redundant, as well as different kinds of, information in fMRI data and how those facts complicate the task of determining whether voxel subsets encode the desired information or whether certain choices of selection method or classifier are universally preferrable. All the results presented were obtained through a comparative study of five fMRI datasets. Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 introduce the Support Vector Decomposition Machine, a new algorithm that attempts to sidestep the use of voxel selection by learning a low dimensional representation of the data that is also suitable for decoding variables of interest and has the potential to allow incorporation of domain information directly, rather than through the proxy of voxel selection criteria.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：18"}, "url": "https://apps.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA480989", "title": "Beyond brain blobs: machine learning classifiers as instruments for analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging data"}

In this study, we systematically calculated a large set of standard and new quantitative markers from individual subject datasets. These features (>12,000 per subject) consisted of local anatomical attributes such as cortical thickness and structure volumes and both local and global resting state network measures. Three methods were used to compute graphs representing interdependencies between activations in different brain areas, and a full set of network features was derived from each. Of these, features derived from the inverse of the time series covariance matrix, under an L1-norm regularization penalty, proved most powerful.

However, there has been little systematic comparison of the two methods. Pairwise rating has the advantage of greater precision, but triplet ranking is potentially a cognitive less taxing task, thus resulting in less noisy responses. Here, we introduce several informationtheoretic measures of how useful responses from the two protocols are for the purpose of response prediction and parameter estimation. Using face similarity data collected on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we demonstrate that triplet ranking is significantly better for extracting subject-specific preferences, while the two are comparable when pooling across subjects. While the specific conclusions should be interpreted cautiously, due to the particularly simple Bayesian model for response generation utilized here, the work provides a information-theoretic framework for quantifying how repetitions within and across subjects can help to combat noise in human responses, as well as giving some insight into the nature of similarity representation and response noise in humans. More generally, this work demonstrates that substantial noise and inconsistency corrupt similarity judgments, both within-and across-subjects, with consequent implications for experimental design and data interpretation.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：5"}, "url": "https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1a1e/d320882c00c94d9f738b7b14eadd941376ed.pdf", "title": "Extracting human face similarity judgments: Pairs or triplets?"}

Using single-trial analysis with temporal localization techniques, we are able to identify a cascade of cognitive events associated with perceptual decision making, including what happens outside the period of evidence accumulation. The goal of this dissertation is to elucidate the association between neural correlates of these cognitive events. We design a set of experimental paradigms based on visual discrimination of scrambled face, car and house images and analyze EEG evoked potentials and oscillations using advanced machine learning and statistical analysis approaches. We first exploit the correlation between pre-stimulus attention and oscillatory activity and investigate such covariation within the context of behaviorally-latent fluctuations in task-relevant post-stimulus neural activity. We find that early perceptual representations, rather than temporally later neural correlates of the perceptual decision, are modulated by pre-stimulus brain state.

We simultaneously analyze amplitude modulations of the SSVEP and endogenous alpha activity as a function of task difficulty. SSVEP modulation can be viewed as a neural marker of attention toward/away from the primary task, while modulation of post-stimulus alpha is closely related to cortical information processing. We find that as the task becomes more difficult, the amplitude of SSVEP decreases significantly, approximately 250-450ms post-stimulus. Significant changes in endogenous alpha amplitude follow SSVEP modulation, occurring at approximately 400-700ms post-stimulus and, unlike the SSVEP, the alpha amplitude is increasingly suppressed as the task becomes less difficult.

Two dimensions of decision making that substantially affect choice are the objective perceptual properties of the stimulus (e.g., salience) and its subjective value. Here we measure EEGs in human subjects to relate their feedback-evoked EEG responses to estimates of prediction error given a neurally derived expected value for each trial.

These models are typically formulated to optimize an objective function that maximizes decoding accuracy. For decoding models trained on full-brain data, this can result in multiple models that yield the same classification accuracy, though some may be more reproducible than others—ie small changes to the training set may result in very different voxels being selected. This issue of reproducibility can be partially controlled by regularizing the decoding model. Regularization, along with the cross-validation used to estimate decoding accuracy, typically requires retraining many (often on the order of thousands) of related decoding models. In this paper we describe an approach that uses a combination of bootstrapping and permutation testing to construct both a measure of cross-validated prediction accuracy and model reproducibility of the learned brain maps. This requires re-training our classification method on many re-sampled versions of the fMRI data. Given the size of fMRI datasets, this is normally a time-consuming process. Our approach leverages an algorithm called fast simultaneous training of generalized linear models (FaSTGLZ) to create a family of classifiers in the space of accuracy vs. reproducibility. The convex hull of this family of classifiers can be used to identify a subset of Pareto optimal classifiers, with a single-optimal classifier selectable based on the relative cost of accuracy vs. reproducibility.

We use it here to examine how the dynamics of the functional connections of regional brain networks are altered in neocortical focal epilepsy. Using task-free fMRI data from 21 subjects with focal epilepsy and 21 healthy controls, we calculated the power spectral density of DRePS, which is a measure of signal variability in local connectivity estimates.

These models are typically formulated to optimize an objective function that maximizes decoding accuracy. For decoding models trained on full-brain data, this can result in multiple models that yield the same classification accuracy, though some may be more reproducible than others—i.e. small changes to the training set may result in very different voxels being selected. This issue of reproducibility can be partially controlled by regularizing the decoding model. Regularization, along with the cross-validation used to estimate decoding accuracy, typically requires retraining many (often on the order of thousands) of related decoding models. In this paper we describe an approach that uses a combination of bootstrapping and permutation testing to construct both a measure of cross-validated prediction accuracy and model reproducibility of the learned brain maps. This requires re-training our classification method on many re-sampled versions of the fMRI data. Given the size of fMRI datasets, this is normally a time-consuming process. Our approach leverages an algorithm called fast simultaneous training of generalized linear models (FaSTGLZ) to create a family of classifiers in the space of accuracy vs. reproducibility. The convex hull of this family of classifiers can be used to identify a subset of Pareto optimal classifiers, with a single-optimal classifier selectable based on the relative cost of accuracy vs. reproducibility.

We used an auditory oddball task with a data-driven approach to learn task-relevant projections of the EEG, for windows of data spanning the entire trial. We investigated linear and quadratic relationships between the evoked EEG along these projections and both prestimulus (baseline) and poststimulus (evoked dilation) pupil diameter measurements.

Being a smooth mapping from latent to data space, it focusses on keeping things apart in latent space that are far apart in data space. In this paper we first provide an overview of dimensionality reduction techniques, placing the emphasis on the kind of distance relation preserved. We then show how the GP-LVM can be generalized, through back constraints, to additionally preserve local distances.

Independent components analysis is the reference approach to estimate spatial components from weakly structured data such as brain signal time courses; each of these components may be referred to as a brain network and the whole set of components can be conceptualized as a brain functional atlas. Recently, new methods using a sparsity prior have emerged to deal with low signal-to-noise ratio data. However, even when using sophisticated priors, the results may not be very sparse and most often do not separate the spatial components into brain regions. This work presents post-processing techniques that automatically sparsify brain maps and separate regions properly using geometric operations, and compares these techniques according to faithfulness to data and stability metrics.

Our approach is based on the following key result that we prove in the paper: if an MLN has no shared terms then MAP inference over it can be reduced to MAP inference over a Markov network having the following properties:(i) the number of random variables in the Markov network is equal to the number of first-order atoms in the MLN; and (ii) the domain size of each variable in the Markov network is equal to the number of groundings of the corresponding firstorder atom. We show that inference over this Markov network is exponentially more efficient than ground inference, namely inference over the Markov network obtained by grounding all firstorder atoms in the MLN. We improve this result further by showing that if non-shared MLNs contain no self joins, namely every atom appears at most once in each of its formulas, then all variables in the corresponding Markov network need only be bi-valued.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：32"}, "url": "http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v33/sarkhel14.pdf", "title": "Lifted MAP inference for Markov logic networks"}

This mechanism, usually referred to as quantum cutting, is here investigated in order to develop luminescent solar converters able to transform the visible and UV solar photons into several photons with energy around 1µm. The rare-earth couple Pr3+-Yb3+ presents a level structure particularly suitable for the quantum cutting mechanism since, upon absorption of a visible photon by Pr3+ (donor), two resonant energy transfers can take place through neighboring Yb3+ ions (acceptors). The efficiency of the Pr3+→Yb3+ energy transfers is here investigated within the host materials KY3F10 and CaF2. The study of the energy transfers in KY3F10 reveals a high transfer rate but also, a remarkable quenching of the Yb3+ emission. On the other hand, the investigation of the Pr3+→Yb3+ energy transfers using CaF2 as host material is particularly interesting because of the formation of rare-earth aggregates. The short distance between the dopants forming the clusters favors the apparition of extremely efficient energy transfers in this material. The quantum cutting process is finally studied with the rare-earths Tb3+ and Yb3+ in CaF2. In this case, the simultaneous excitation of two Yb3+ ions takes place through a single cooperative energy transfer from Tb3+ ions. The cooperative mechanism is known to be less efficient than resonant energy transfers , nevertheless, the rare-earth clustering in CaF2 codoped Tb3+-Yb3+ gives rise to energy transfer efficiencies notably higher than that …", "引用总数": "被引用次数：1"}, "url": "https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01092812/", "title": "Quantum Cutting Processes in Rare-earth doped fluorides for Photovoltaic applications"}

The estimated deformation fields are then applied to the subject's EPI scans (functional or diffusion-weighted images) to warp the latter to a template space. Historically, such indirect T1w-based registration was motivated by the lack of clear anatomical details in low-resolution EPI images: a direct registration of the EPI scans to template space would be futile. A central prerequisite in such indirect methods is that the anatomical (aka the T1w) image of each subject is well aligned with their EPI images via rigid coregistration. We provide experimental evidence that things have changed: nowadays, there is a decent amount of anatomical contrast in high-resolution EPI data. That notwithstanding, EPI distortions due to B0 inhomogeneities cannot be fully corrected. Residual uncorrected distortions induce non-rigid deformations between the EPI scans and the same subject's anatomical scan. In this manuscript, we contribute a computationally cheap pipeline that leverages the high spatial resolution of modern EPI scans for direct inter-subject matching. Our pipeline is direct and does not rely on the T1w scan to estimate the inter-subject deformation.

For instance, anatomical MR images can reveal certain disease conditions, while their functional counterparts can predict neuropsychi-atric phenotypes. However, a physician will not rely on predictions by black-box models: understanding the anatomical or functional features that underpin decision is critical. Generally, the weight vectors of clas-sifiers are not easily amenable to such an examination: Often there is no apparent structure. Indeed, this is not only a prediction task, but also an inverse problem that calls for adequate regularization. We address this challenge by introducing a convex region-selecting penalty. Our penalty combines total-variation regularization, enforcing spatial conti-guity, and 1 regularization, enforcing sparsity, into one group: Voxels are either active with non-zero spatial derivative or zero with inactive spatial derivative. This leads to segmenting contiguous spatial regions (inside which the signal can vary freely) against a background of zeros. Such segmentation of medical images in a target-informed manner is an important analysis tool. On several prediction problems from brain MRI, the penalty shows good segmentation.

Markov logic (Richardson & Domingos, 2006) accomplishes this by attaching weights to first-order formulas and viewing them as templates for features of Markov networks. Unfortunately, it does not have the full power of first-order logic, because it is only defined for finite domains. This paper extends Markov logic to infinite domains, by casting it in the framework of Gibbs measures (Georgii, 1988). We show that a Markov logic network (MLN) admits a Gibbs measure as long as each ground atom has a finite number of neighbors. Many interesting cases fall in this category. We also show that an MLN admits a unique measure if the weights of its non-unit clauses are small enough. We then examine the structure of the set of consistent measures in the non-unique case. Many important phenomena, including systems with phase transitions, are represented by MLNs with non-unique measures. We relate the problem of satisfiability in first-order logic to the properties of MLN measures, and discuss how Markov logic relates to previous infinite models.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：70"}, "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5292", "title": "Markov logic in infinite domains"}

More recently, weighted satisfiability solvers have been used successfully for MPE inference in statistical relational learners (Singla & Domingos 2005). However, fully instantiating a finite first-order theory requires memory on the order of the number of constants raised to the arity of the clauses, which significantly limits the size of domains it can be applied to. In this paper we propose LazySAT, a variation of the Walk-SAT solver that avoids this blowup by taking advantage of the extreme sparseness that is typical of relational domains (ie, only a small fraction of ground atoms are true, and most clauses are trivially satisfied). Experiments on entity resolution and planning problems show that LazySAT reduces memory usage by orders of magnitude compared to Walk-SAT, while taking comparable time to run and producing the same solutions.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：116"}, "url": "https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2006/AAAI06-078.pdf", "title": "Memory-efficient inference in relational domains"}

Operator-Valued Kernels and vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces provide a theoretical and practical framework to address that issue, extending nicely the well-known setting of scalar-valued kernels. However large scale applications are usually not affordable with these tools that require an important computational power along with a large memory capacity. In this thesis, we propose and study scalable methods to perform regression with Operator-Valued Kernels. To achieve this goal, we extend Random Fourier Features, an approximation technique originally introduced for scalar-valued kernels, to Operator-Valued Kernels. The idea is to take advantage of an approximated operator-valued feature map in order to come up with a linear model in a finite-dimensional space. This thesis is structured as follows. First we develop a general framework devoted to the approximation of shift-invariant MErcer kernels on Locally Compact Abelian groups and study their properties along with the complexity of the algorithms based on them. Second we show theoretical guarantees by bounding the error due to the approximation, with high probability. Third, we study various applications of Operator Random Fourier Features (ORFF) to different tasks of Machine learning such as multi-class classification, multi-task learning, time serie modelling, functionnal regression and anomaly detection.

Ideally, inference should be lifted as in first-order logic, handling whole sets of indistinguishable objects together, in time independent of their cardinality. Poole (2003) and Braz et al.(2005, 2006) developed a lifted version of the variable elimination algorithm, but it is extremely complex, generally does not scale to realistic domains, and has only been applied to very small artificial problems. In this paper we propose the first lifted version of a scalable probabilistic inference algorithm, belief propagation (loopy or not). Our approach is based on first constructing a lifted network, where each node represents a set of ground atoms that all pass the same messages during belief propagation.

Random Fourier features (RFF) are among the most popular and widely applied constructions: they provide an easily computable, low-dimensional feature representation for shift-invariant kernels. Despite the popularity of RFFs, very little is understood theoretically about their approximation quality. In this paper, we provide a detailed finite-sample theoretical analysis about the approximation quality of RFFs by (i) establishing optimal (in terms of the RFF dimension, and growing set size) performance guarantees in uniform norm, and (ii) presenting guarantees in L^ r (1≤ r<∞) norms.

This representation overcomes both the problem of in-class variability and provides a low false detection rate in unconstrained environments. We demonstrate the capabilities of the technique in two domains whose inherent information content differs significantly. The first system is face detection and the second is the domain of people which, in contrast to faces, vary greatly in color, texture, and patterns. Unlike previous approaches, this system learns from examples and does not rely on any a priori (handcrafted) models or motion-based segmentation.

Before The Computational Brain was published in 1992, conceptual frameworks for brain function were based on the behavior of single neurons, applied globally. In The Computational Brain, Patricia Churchland and Terrence Sejnowski developed a different conceptual framework, based on large populations of neurons. They did this by showing that patterns of activities among the units in trained artificial neural network models had properties that resembled those recorded from populations of neurons recorded one at a time. It is one of the first books to bring together computational concepts and behavioral data within a neurobiological framework. Aimed at a broad audience of neuroscientists, computer scientists, cognitive scientists, and philosophers, The Computational Brain is written for both expert and novice. This anniversary edition offers a new preface by the authors that puts the book in the context of current research. This approach influenced a generation of researchers. Even today, when neuroscientists can routinely record from hundreds of neurons using optics rather than electricity, and the 2013 White House BRAIN initiative heralded a new era in innovative neurotechnologies, the main message of The Computational Brain is still relevant.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：2742"}, "url": "http://c.glgoo.top/books?hl=en&lr=&id=z4pfDQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR5&dq=info:mARQmikcVOgJ:c.glgoo.top&ots=QX8E5mJiSU&sig=pVQfuvFLCIUyplYJQoAHhYFOaJ0", "title": "The computational brain"}

The model consists of two sub-networks: a deep recurrent neural network for sentences and a deep convolutional network for images. These two sub-networks interact with each other in a multimodal layer to form the whole m-RNN model. The effectiveness of our model is validated on four benchmark datasets (IAPR TC-12, Flickr 8K, Flickr 30K and MS COCO). Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we apply the m-RNN model to retrieval tasks for retrieving images or sentences, and achieves significant performance improvement over the state-of-the-art methods which directly optimize the ranking objective function for retrieval.

For example, computational vision is, for the most part, concerned with the de velopment of algorithms for distilling information about the world and recognition of various objects in the environ (eg localization ment) from visual images (eg photographs or video frames). There are often a multitude of ways in which a specific piece of informa tion about the world can be obtained from sensory data. A subarea of research into sensory systems has arisen which is concerned with methods for combining these various information sources. This field is known as data fusion, or sensor fusion. The literature on data fusion is extensive, indicating the intense interest in this topic, but is quite chaotic. There are no accepted approaches, save for a few special cases, and many of the best methods are ad hoc. This book represents our attempt at providing a mathematical foundation upon which data fusion algorithms can be constructed and analyzed. The methodology that we present in this text is mo tivated by a strong belief in the importance of constraints in sensory information processing systems. In our view, data fusion is best un derstood as the embedding of multiple constraints on the solution to a sensory information processing problem into the solution pro cess.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：651"}, "url": "http://c.glgoo.top/books?hl=en&lr=&id=w-bcBwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR13&dq=info:qfYhA9cSML8J:c.glgoo.top&ots=p4opCw0oS5&sig=DUzL7zG2XzOHuQ_tENh81r0_xsM", "title": "Data fusion for sensory information processing systems"}

Images are no exception: changes in light intensity reflect the many spatial scales at which visible surfaces are organized. It seems intuitive that a great deal of information can be gained by an analysis of the changes in a signal at different scales. For instance, graphs of onedimensional functions are a very effective tool for describing complex systems. An important reason is that they allow direct visual access to important properties of the data, chiefly to their changes over different scales. The idea of scale is critical for a symbolic description of the significant changes in images or other types of signals. Changes must be detected at different levels of detail and over different extents. In general different physical processes may be associated with a characteristic behavior across different scales. In an image, changes of intensity take place at many spatial scales depending on their physical origin. A multiscale analysis, tracing the behavior of some feature of the signal across scales, can reveal previous information about the nature of the underlying physical process. In images, for instance, spatial coincidence at all scales of zero-crossings in the Laplacian of the inten-* Part of the work described in this paper appears in Artificial Intelligence Laboratory memo 722, published in June, 1983 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Bioinformatics is the development and application of computer methods for management, analysis, interpretation, and prediction, as well as for the design of experiments. Machine learning approaches (eg, neural networks, hidden Markov models, and belief networks) are ideally suited for areas where there is a lot of data but little theory, which is the situation in molecular biology. The goal in machine learning is to extract useful information from a body of data by building good probabilistic models--and to automate the process as much as possible. In this book Pierre Baldi and Søren Brunak present the key machine learning approaches and apply them to the computational problems encountered in the analysis of biological data. The book is aimed both at biologists and biochemists who need to understand new data-driven algorithms and at those with a primary background in physics, mathematics, statistics, or computer science who need to know more about applications in molecular biology. This new second edition contains expanded coverage of probabilistic graphical models and of the applications of neural networks, as well as a new chapter on microarrays and gene expression.

The presented method quantitatively compares peptide abundances from experiments using 18O/16O labeling starting from elaborated MS spectra. It was originally developed to study signaling cascades activated by amyloid-β treatment of neurons used as a cellular model system with relevance to Alzheimer's disease, but is generally applicable. The presented method assesses, in complete cell lysates, the degree of phosphorylation of specific peptide residues from MS spectra using 18O/16O labeling. The abundance of each observed phospho-peptide from two cell states was estimated from three overlapping isotope contours. The influence of peptide-specific labeling efficiency was removed by performing a label swapped experiment and assuming that the labeling efficiency was unchanged upon label swapping. Different degrees of phosphorylation were reported using the fold change measure which was extended with a confidence interval found to reflect the quality of the underlying spectra. Furthermore a new way of method assessment using simulated data is presented. Using simulated data generated in a manner mimicking real data it was possible to show the method's robustness both with increasing noise levels and with decreasing labeling efficiency.

For each sequence separation we define a distance threshold. For pairs of amino acids where the distance between C α atoms is smaller than the threshold, a characteristic sequence (logo) motif, is found. The motifs change as the sequence separation increases: for small separations they consist of one peak located in between the two residues, then additional peaks at these residues appear, and finally the center peak smears out for very large separations. We also find correlations between the residues in the center of the motif. This and other statistical analyses are used to design neural networks with enhanced performance compared to earlier work. Importantly, the statistical analysis explains why neural networks perform better than simple statistical data-driven approaches such as pair probability density functions. The statistical results also explain characteristics of the network performance for increasing sequence separation. The improvement of the new network design is significant in the sequence separation range 10–30 residues.

Specifically, the use of precision-recall analysis is investigated and compared to the more well known performance measures such as error-rate and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). We argue that while ROC analysis is invariant to variations in class priors, this invariance in fact hides an important factor of the evaluation in imprecise environments.

This model is largely based on a previously proposed model, but has a number of modifications that make it more amenable to potential integration into a wavelet based image compression scheme. These modifications include the use of a separable wavelet transform instead of the cortex transform, the application of a wavelet contrast sensitivity function (CSF), and a simplified definition of subband contrast that allows us to predict noise visibility directly from wavelet coefficients. Initially, we outline the luminance, frequency, and masking sensitivities of the HVS and discuss how these can be incorporated into the wavelet transform. We then outline a number of limitations of the wavelet transform as a model of the HVS, namely the lack of translational invariance and poor orientation sensitivity. In order to investigate the efficacy of this wavelet based model, a wavelet visible difference predictor (WVDP) is described. The WVDP is then used to predict visible differences between an original and compressed (or noisy) image. Results are presented to emphasize the limitations of commonly used measures of image quality and to demonstrate the performance of the WVDP.

In a healthy individual, bacterial flora serves to protect the host. Under certain conditions such as minor trauma, impaired host immunity, or environmental factors, the risk of developing skin infections is increased. Although a large majority of bacterial associated skin infections are common, a portion can potentially manifest into clinically significant morbidity. For example, Gram positive species that typically reside on the skin such as Staphylococcus and Streptococcus can cause numerous epidermal (impetigo, ecthyma) and dermal (cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, erysipelas) skin infections. Moreover, the increasing incidence of bacterial antibiotic resistance represents a serious challenge to modern medicine and threatens the health care system. Therefore, it is critical to develop tools and strategies that can allow us to better elucidate the nature and mechanism of bacterial virulence.

Here, we examined whether protein phospho-modifications occur during germination, the first step of exiting dormancy, thereby facilitating spore revival. Utilizing Bacillus subtilis as a model organism, we performed phosphoproteomic analysis to define the Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphoproteome of a reviving spore. The phosphoproteome was found to chiefly comprise newly identified phosphorylation sites located within proteins involved in basic biological functions, such as transcription, translation, carbon metabolism, and spore-specific determinants. Quantitative comparison of dormant and germinating spore phosphoproteomes revealed phosphorylation dynamics, indicating that phospho-modifications could modulate protein activity during this cellular transition. Furthermore, by mutating select phosphorylation sites located within proteins representative of key biological processes, we established a functional connection between phosphorylation and the progression of spore revival. Herein, we provide, for the first time, a phosphoproteomic view of a germinating bacterial spore. We further show that the spore phosphoproteome is dynamic and present evidence that phosphorylation events play an integral role in facilitating spore revival.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：13"}, "url": "https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-015-0184-7", "title": "Phosphoproteome dynamics mediate revival of bacterial spores"}

The mechanisms by which Streptococcus pneumoniae achieves its characteristic ellipsoid-cell shape remain largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the interplay of the cell division paralogs DivIVA and GpsB with the ser/thr kinase StkP. We observed that the deletion of divIVA hindered cell elongation and resulted in cell shortening and rounding. By contrast, the absence of GpsB resulted in hampered cell division and triggered cell elongation. Remarkably, ΔgpsB elongated cells exhibited a helical FtsZ pattern instead of a Z-ring, accompanied by helical patterns for DivIVA and peptidoglycan synthesis. Strikingly, divIVA deletion suppressed the elongated phenotype of ΔgpsB cells. These data suggest that DivIVA promotes cell elongation and that GpsB counteracts it. Analysis of protein-protein interactions revealed that GpsB and DivIVA do not interact with FtsZ but with the cell division protein EzrA, which itself interacts with FtsZ. In addition, GpsB interacts directly with DivIVA. These results are consistent with DivIVA and GpsB acting as a molecular switch to orchestrate peripheral and septal PG synthesis and connecting them with the Z-ring via EzrA. The cellular co-localization of the transpeptidases PBP2x and PBP2b as well as the lipid-flippases FtsW and RodA in ΔgpsB cells further suggest the existence of a single large PG assembly complex.

The verification process is for the most part automatic. User interaction occurs mostly at the highest, most intuitive level, primarily through a graphical proof language of verification diagrams. Efficient simplification methods, decision procedures, and invariant generation techniques are then invoked automatically to prove resulting first-order verification conditions with minimal assistance.

By proving that DeepWalk, a state-of-the-art network representation method, is actually equivalent to matrix factorization (MF), we propose text-associated DeepWalk (TADW). TADW incorporates text features of vertices into network representation learning under the framework of matrix factorization. We evaluate our method and various baseline methods by applying them to the task of multi-class classification of vertices.

It also describes several key aspects of the application of these algorithms. The authors aim to present novel theoretical tools and concepts while giving concise proofs even for relatively advanced topics. Foundations of Machine Learning is unique in its focus on the analysis and theory of algorithms. The first four chapters lay the theoretical foundation for what follows; subsequent chapters are mostly self-contained. Topics covered include the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework; generalization bounds based on Rademacher complexity and VC-dimension; Support Vector Machines (SVMs); kernel methods; boosting; on-line learning; multi-class classification; ranking; regression; algorithmic stability; dimensionality reduction; learning automata and languages; and reinforcement learning. Each chapter ends with a set of exercises. Appendixes provide additional material including concise probability review.

Little attention has been devoted to the development of data representation that can be used to improve a user's ability to interpret the data and machine learning models to solve real-world problems. In this paper, we quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate an efficient, accurate and scalable feature-compression method using latent Dirichlet allocation for discrete data. This representation can effectively communicate the characteristics of high-dimensional, complex data points. We show that the improvement of a user's interpretability through the use of a topic modeling-based compression technique is statistically significant, according to a number of metrics, when compared with other representations. Also, we find that this representation is scalable---it maintains alignment with human classification accuracy as an increasing number of data points are shown. In addition, the learned topic layer can semantically deliver meaningful information to users that could potentially aid human reasoning about data characteristics in connection with compressed topic space.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：11"}, "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/viewPaper/9738", "title": "Scalable and interpretable data representation for high-dimensional complex data"}

Deployment plans for these operations are frequently negotiated on-the-fly by teams of human planners. A human operator then translates the agreed-upon plan into machine instructions for the robots. We present an algorithm that reduces this translation burden by inferring the final plan from a processed form of the human team's planning conversation. Our hybrid approach combines probabilistic generative modeling with logical plan validation used to compute a highly structured prior over possible plans, enabling us to overcome the challenge of performing inference over a large solution space with only a small amount of noisy data from the team planning session. We validate the algorithm through human subject experimentations and show that it is able to infer a human team's final plan with 86% accuracy on average. We also describe a robot demonstration in which two people plan and execute a first-response collaborative task with a PR2 robot.

Several proposed local explanation methods address this issue by identifying what dimensions of a single input are most responsible for a DNN's output. The goal of this work is to assess the sensitivity of local explanations to DNN parameter values. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that DNNs with randomly-initialized weights produce explanations that are both visually and quantitatively similar to those produced by DNNs with learned weights. Our conjecture is that this phenomenon occurs because these explanations are dominated by the lower level features of a DNN, and that a DNN's architecture provides a strong prior which significantly affects the representations learned at these lower layers.

Machine learning techniques and humans have skills that complement each other - machine learning techniques are good at computation on data at the lowest level of granularity, whereas people are better at abstracting knowledge from their experience, and transferring the knowledge across domains. The goal of this thesis is to develop a framework for human-in-the-loop machine learning that enables people to interact effectively with machine learning models to make better decisions, without requiring in-depth knowledge about machine learning techniques. Many of us interact with machine learning systems everyday. Systems that mine data for product recommendations, for example, are ubiquitous. However these systems compute their output without end-user involvement, and there are typically no life or death consequences in the case the machine learning result is not acceptable to the user. In contrast, domains where decisions can have serious consequences (e.g., emergency response panning, medical decision-making), require the incorporation of human experts' domain knowledge. These systems also must be transparent to earn experts' trust and be adopted in their workflow.

Many existing methods for learning the dynamics of physical interactions require labeled object information. However, to scale real-world interaction learning to a variety of scenes and objects, acquiring labeled data becomes increasingly impractical. To learn about physical object motion without labels, we develop an action-conditioned video prediction model that explicitly models pixel motion, by predicting a distribution over pixel motion from previous frames. Because our model explicitly predicts motion, it is partially invariant to object appearance, enabling it to generalize to previously unseen objects. To explore video prediction for real-world interactive agents, we also introduce a dataset of 59,000 robot interactions involving pushing motions, including a test set with novel objects. In this dataset, accurate prediction of videos conditioned on the robot's future actions amounts to learning a\" visual imagination\" of different futures based on different courses of action.

Adversarial examples that affect one model often affect another model, even if the two models have different architectures or were trained on different training sets, so long as both models were trained to perform the same task. An attacker may therefore train their own substitute model, craft adversarial examples against the substitute, and transfer them to a victim model, with very little information about the victim. Recent work has further developed a technique that uses the victim model as an oracle to label a synthetic training set for the substitute, so the attacker need not even collect a training set to mount the attack. We extend these recent techniques using reservoir sampling to greatly enhance the efficiency of the training procedure for the substitute model. We introduce new transferability attacks between previously unexplored (substitute, victim) pairs of machine learning model classes, most notably SVMs and decision trees. We demonstrate our attacks on two commercial machine learning classification systems from Amazon (96.19% misclassification rate) and Google (88.94%) using only 800 queries of the victim model, thereby showing that existing machine learning approaches are in general vulnerable to systematic black-box attacks regardless of their structure.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：308"}, "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07277", "title": "Transferability in machine learning: from phenomena to black-box attacks using adversarial samples"}

To demonstrate this idea, we have implemented TaintCheck, a mechanism that can perform dynamic taint analysis by performing binary rewriting at run time.

We describe our cryptographic schemes for the problem of searching on encrypted data and provide proofs of security for the resulting crypto systems. Our techniques have a number of crucial advantages.

Second, in the multipath-reinforcement scheme, we show how to strengthen the security between any two nodes by leveraging the security of other links.

Adversarial training injects such examples into training data to increase robustness. To scale this technique to large datasets, perturbations are crafted using fast single-step methods that maximize a linear approximation of the model's loss. We show that this form of adversarial training converges to a degenerate global minimum, wherein small curvature artifacts near the data points obfuscate a linear approximation of the loss. The model thus learns to generate weak perturbations, rather than defend against strong ones. As a result, we find that adversarial training remains vulnerable to black-box attacks, where we transfer perturbations computed on undefended models, as well as to a powerful novel single-step attack that escapes the non-smooth vicinity of the input data via a small random step. We further introduce Ensemble Adversarial Training, a technique that augments training data with perturbations transferred from other models. On ImageNet, Ensemble Adversarial Training yields models with strong robustness to black-box attacks.

An adversarial example is a sample of input data which has been modified very slightly in a way that is intended to cause a machine learning classifier to misclassify it. In many cases, these modifications can be so subtle that a human observer does not even notice the modification at all, yet the classifier still makes a mistake. Adversarial examples pose security concerns because they could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems, even if the adversary has no access to the underlying model. Up to now, all previous work have assumed a threat model in which the adversary can feed data directly into the machine learning classifier. This is not always the case for systems operating in the physical world, for example those which are using signals from cameras and other sensors as an input. This paper shows that even in such physical world scenarios, machine learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples. We demonstrate this by feeding adversarial images obtained from cell-phone camera to an ImageNet Inception classifier and measuring the classification accuracy of the system. We find that a large fraction of adversarial examples are classified incorrectly even when perceived through the camera.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：696"}, "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02533", "title": "Adversarial examples in the physical world"}

Different from the spammers in traditional systems such as SMS and email, spammers in social media behave like normal users and they continue to change their spamming strategies to fool anti spamming systems.

This is especially true when users can easily express themselves with their likes and dislikes for certain items. In this paper, we explore how to use the binary preference data expressed in the form of like/dislike to help reduce the impact of data sparsity of more expressive numerical ratings. We do this by transferring the rating knowledge from some auxiliary data source in binary form (that is, likes or dislikes), to a target numerical rating matrix. Our solution is to model both numerical ratings and like/dislike in a principled way, using a novel framework of Transfer by Collective Factorization (TCF).

Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant, labeled data for learning these specific tasks is scarce, making it challenging for discriminatively trained models to perform adequately. We demonstrate that large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative fine-tuning on each specific task. In contrast to previous approaches, we make use of task-aware input transformations during fine-tuning to achieve effective transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of benchmarks for natural language understanding. Our general task-agnostic model outperforms discriminatively trained models that use architectures specifically crafted for each task, significantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied.

Such reparameterizations with local noise can be trivially parallelized and have variance that is inversely proportional to the minibatch size, generally leading to much faster convergence. We find an important connection with regularization by dropout: the original Gaussian dropout objective corresponds to SGVB with local noise, a scale-invariant prior and proportionally fixed posterior variance.

Semantics in the text is largely ignored in the mining process, and the mining results are often not easily interpretable. One particular challenge faced by such approaches is short text understanding, as short text lacks enough content from which a statistical conclusion can be drawn. For example, traditional topic analysis methods consider topic segments with tens of hundreds of words. Latent topic modeling, such as latent Dirichlet allocation, also requires sufficient words to infer document topic distribution. We enhance machine learning algorithms by first giving the machine a probabilistic knowledgebase that contains as big, rich, and consistent concepts (of worldly facts) as those in our mental world. Then a Bayesian inference mechanism is developed to conceptualize words and short text. We conducted comprehensive tests of our method on conceptualizing set of text terms, as well as clustering Twitter messages (tweets), which are typically approximately ten words long.

This method evolves individuals that are better able to learn. We present a fully implemented instantiation of evolutionary function approximation which combines NEAT, a neuroevolutionary optimization technique, with Q-learning, a popular TD method. The resulting NEAT+ Q algorithm automatically discovers effective representations for neural network function approximators. This paper also presents on-line evolutionary computation, which improves the on-line performance of evolutionary computation by borrowing selection mechanisms used in TD methods to choose individual actions and using them in evolutionary computation to select policies for evaluation.

The resulting Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN), although capable of seeing only a single frame at each timestep, successfully integrates information through time and replicates DQN's performance on standard Atari games and partially observed equivalents featuring flickering game screens. Additionally, when trained with partial observations and evaluated with incrementally more complete observations, DRQN's performance scales as a function of observability. Conversely, when trained with full observations and evaluated with partial observations, DRQN's performance degrades less than DQN's. Thus, given the same length of history, recurrency is a viable alternative to stacking a history of frames in the DQN's input layer and while recurrency confers no systematic advantage when learning to play the game, the recurrent net can better adapt at evaluation time if the quality of observations changes.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：328"}, "url": "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FSS/FSS15/paper/viewPaper/11673", "title": "Deep recurrent q-learning for partially observable mdps"}

First, it describes an architecture within which a flexible team structure allows member agents to decompose a task into flexible roles and to switch roles while acting.

The derivational analogy method has been fully implemented in the PRODIGY architecture and proven empirically to be amenable to scaling up both in terms of domain and problem complexity. Reasoning by analogy involves a set of challenging problems, namely: how to accumulate episodic problem solving experience, how to define and decide when two problem solving situations are similar, how to organize large amounts of knowledge so that it may be efficiently retrieved, and finally the ultimate problem of how to successfully transfer chains of reasoning from past experience to new problem solving situations when only a partial match exists among corresponding problems. More specifically, the dissertation automates the generation, storage, dynamic indexation, retrieval and replay for multiple cases (ie derivational traces of past problem solving episodes). Learning occurs by accumulation and flexible reuse of cases. The problem solving search effort is reduced incrementally as more episodic experience is compiled into the case library. Scaling up the system proved to be very demanding. The current system has thus far been demonstrated in multiple domains, including a complex logistics transportation domain where it generated a library of 1000 cases, showed strong improvements in problem-solving performance, and pushed the solvability envelope to increasingly more complex classes-of problems.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：306"}, "url": "https://apps.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA256573", "title": "Learning by analogical reasoning in general problem solving"}

To alleviate this computational difficulty, this paper presents an information-theoretic approach to MASP (iMASP) for efficient adaptive path planning; by reformulating the cost-minimizing iMASP as a reward-maximizing problem, its time complexity becomes independent of map resolution and is less sensitive to increasing robot team size as demonstrated both theoretically and empirically. Using the reward-maximizing dual, we derive a novel adaptive variant of maximum entropy sampling, thus improving the induced exploration policy performance. It also allows us to establish theoretical bounds quantifying the performance advantage of optimal adaptive over non-adaptive policies and the performance quality of approximately optimal vs. optimal adaptive policies.

The efficacy of these systems is a function of the density of deployment and of anchor nodes, as well as the error in distance estimation (ranging) between nodes. In this paper, we examine how these factors impact the performance of the system.

This motivates the potential to mine information from Twitter, which can serve as a valuable resource for applications such as event localization and location-specific recommendation systems. Geolocation of Twitter messages is integral to such applications. However, only aa small percentage of Twitter posts are accompanied by a GPS location. Recent works have begun exploring ways to estimate the unknown location of Twitter users based on the content of their posts and various available metadata. This presents interesting challenges for natural language processing and multi-objective optimization. We propose a new method for estimating the home location of users based on both the content of their posts and their social connections on Twitter.

It achieves robustness by combining sensor information from a laser range finder, a pose estimation system and a color camera. Using the first two modalities, the system first identifies a nearby patch of drivable surface. Computer Vision then takes this patch and uses it to construct appearance models to find drivable surface outward into the far range. This information is put into a drivability map for the vehicle path planner. In addition to evaluating the method’s performance using a scoring framework run on real-world data, the system was entered, and won, the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge.

Veridical judgment and categorical discrimination have traditionally been conceptualized as two distinct computational problems. Here, we found that these two types of decision making can be subserved by a shared cortical circuit mechanism. We used a continuous recurrent network model to simulate two monkey experiments in which subjects were required to make either a two-alternative forced choice or a veridical judgment about the direction of random-dot motion. The model network is endowed with a continuum of bell-shaped population activity patterns, each representing a possible motion direction. Slow recurrent excitation underlies accumulation of sensory evidence, and its interplay with strong recurrent inhibition leads to decision behaviors. The model reproduced the monkey's performance as well as single-neuron activity in the categorical discrimination task. Furthermore, we examined how direction identification is determined by a combination of sensory stimulation and microstimulation. Using a population-vector measure, we found that direction judgments instantiate winner-take-all (with the population vector coinciding with either the coherent motion direction or the electrically elicited motion direction) when two stimuli are far apart, or vector averaging (with the population vector falling between the two directions) when two stimuli are close to each other.

Here, we proposed an integrated model of the p53 network and explored how the nuclear and mitochondrial p53 pathways are coordinated to determine cell fates after -irradiation in radiosensitive tissues. Using numerical simulations, we found that depending on the extent of DNA damage, cells may survive, commit apoptosis after cell cycle arrest, or undergo apoptosis soon after irradiation. There exists a large cell-to-cell variability in outcome because of stochasticity in the generation and repair of DNA damage as well as cellular heterogeneity. At the cell population level, there occur two waves of apoptosis: a fast wave mediated by mitochondrial p53 within three hours postirradiation, and a slow wave mediated by nuclear p53 after eight hours postirradiation. Thus, we propose a two-step mechanism for cell fate decision. The first step is to decide whether DNA damage is severe enough to trigger apoptosis directly through the mitochondrial p53 pathway, while the second step is to determine whether the damage is fixed after cell cycle arrest. Such a mechanism may represent an efficient and reliable control mode, avoiding unnecessary death or greatly promoting the execution of apoptosis. It was also demonstrated that nuclear p53 can inhibit the pro-apoptotic activity of mitochondrial p53 by transactivating p21, and Mdm2 can facilitate apoptosis by promoting the mono-ubiquitination of p53.

Activated ATM initiates the p53 oscillator to produce pulses. Consequently, the target genes of p53 are selectively induced to control cell fate.

We proposed a four-module model of the p53 signaling network and associated the network dynamics with cellular outcomes after ionizing radiation. We found that the cellular response is mediated by both the level and posttranslational modifications of p53 and that p53 is activated in a progressive manner. First, p53 is partially activated by primary modifications such as phosphorylation at Ser-15/20 to induce cell cycle arrest, with its level varying in a series of pulses. If the damage cannot be fixed after a critical number of p53 pulses, then p53 is fully activated by further modifications such as phosphorylation at Ser-46 to trigger apoptosis, with its concentration switching to rather high levels.

Computer vision algorithms that are intended to form part of a perceptual user interface must be fast and efficient. They must be able to track in real time yet not absorb a major share of computational resources: other tasks must be able to run while the visual interface is being used. The new algorithm developed here is based on a robust nonparametric technique for climbing density gradients to find the mode (peak) of probability distributions called the mean shift algorithm. In our case, we want to find the mode of a color distribution within a video scene. Therefore, the mean shift algorithm is modified to deal with dynamically changing color probability distributions derived from video frame sequences. The modified algorithm is called the Continuously Adaptive Mean Shift (CAMSHIFT) algorithm. CAMSHIFT’s tracking accuracy is compared against a Polhemus tracker. Tolerance to noise, distractors and performance is studied. CAMSHIFT is then used as a computer interface for controlling commercial computer games and for exploring immersive 3D graphic worlds.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：2550"}, "url": "http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.14.7673", "title": "Computer vision face tracking for use in a perceptual user interface"}

However the traditional RBM architecture and the commonly used training algorithm known as Contrastive Divergence (CD) are based on discrete updates and exact arithmetics which do not directly map onto a dynamical neural substrate.

To overcome problems like partial occlusions, strong illumination changes and motion blur, that notoriously make energy minimization-based tracking methods get trapped in a local minimum, we propose a learning-based method that is robust to all these problems. We use random forests to learn the relation between the parameters that defines the object's motion, and the changes they induce on the image intensities or the point cloud of the template. It follows that, to track the template when it moves, we use the changes on the image intensities or point cloud to predict the parameters of this motion. Our algorithm has an extremely fast tracking performance running at less than 2 ms per frame, and is robust to partial occlusions. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness to strong illumination changes when tracking templates using intensity images, and robustness in tracking 3D objects from arbitrary viewpoints even in the presence of motion blur that causes missing or erroneous data in depth images.

It is defined as a displacement vector field of the same resolution as the SDFs and is determined iteratively via variational minimization. To ensure it generates plausible shapes, we propose a novel regularizer that imposes local rigidity by requiring the deformation to be a smooth and approximately Killing vector field, ie generating nearly isometric motions. Moreover, we enforce that the level set property of unity gradient magnitude is preserved over iterations. As a result, KillingFusion reliably reconstructs objects that are undergoing topological changes and fast inter-frame motion.

They could, thereby, respond so appropriately to our actions that the computing aspects would fade into the background. Underlying this vision is the assumption that sensing a broad set of physical phenomena, rather than just data input, will become a common aspect of small, embedded computers and that these devices will communicate with each other (as well as to some more powerful infrastructure) to organize and coordinate their actions. Recall the story of Sal in Weiser’s article; Sal looked out her window and saw “tracks” as evidence of her neighbors’ morning strolls. What sort of system did this seemingly simple functionality imply? Certainly Weiser did not envision ubiquitous cameras placed throughout the neighborhood. Such a solution would be far too heavy for the application’s relatively casual nature as well as quite invasive with respect to personal privacy. Instead, Weiser posited the existence of far less intrusive instrumentation in neighborhood spaces—perhaps smart paving stones that could detect local activity and indicate the walker’s direction based on exchanges between neighboring nodes. As we have marched technology forward, we are now in a position to translate this aspect of Weiser’s vision to reality and apply it to a wide range of important applications, both computing and social. Other articles in this issue address the user interface-, application-, software-, and device-level design challenges associated with realizing Weiser’s vision.

However, the improvement comes at the cost of increased computational complexity. In this paper, we address this issue by preintegrating inertial measurements between selected keyframes. The preintegration allows us to accurately summarize hundreds of inertial measurements into a single relative motion constraint. Our first contribution is a preintegration theory that properly addresses the manifold structure of the rotation group and carefully deals with uncertainty propagation. The measurements are integrated in a local frame, which eliminates the need to repeat the integration when the linearization point changes while leaving the opportunity for belated bias corrections. The second contribution is to show that the preintegrated IMU model can be seamlessly integrated in a visual-inertial pipeline under the unifying framework of factor graphs. This enables the use of a structureless model for visual measurements, further accelerating the computation. The third contribution is an extensive evaluation of our monocular VIN pipeline: experimental results confirm that our system is very fast and demonstrates superior accuracy with respect to competitive state-of-the-art filtering and optimization algorithms, including off-the-shelf systems such as Google Tango [1].", "引用总数": "被引用次数：186"}, "url": "https://aragorn.library.gatech.edu/handle/1853/55417", "title": "IMU preintegration on manifold for efficient visual-inertial maximum-a-posteriori estimation"}

The algorithm relies on a novel way of removing the outliers of the feature matching process.We show that by exploiting the nonholonomic constraints of wheeled vehicles it is possible to use a restrictive motion model which allows us to parameterize the motion with only 1 feature correspondence. Using a single feature correspondence for motion estimation is the lowest model parameterization possible and results in the most efficient algorithms for removing outliers. Here we present two methods for outlier removal. One based on RANSAC and the other one based on histogram voting.

Likewise, VO operates by incrementally estimating the pose of the vehicle through examination of the changes that motion induces on the images of its onboard cameras.

The majority of the feature extraction systems have a common structure composed of a ﬁlter bank (generally based on oriented edge detectors or 2D Gabor functions), a nonlinear operation (quantization, winner-take-all, sparsiﬁcation, normalization, and/or pointwise saturation), and ﬁnally a pooling operation (max, average, or histogramming). For example, the scale-invariant feature transform (S IFT)(Lowe, 2004) operator applies oriented edge ﬁlters to a small patch and determines the dominant orientation through a winner-take-all operation. Finally, the resulting sparse vectors are added (pooled) over a larger patch to form a local orientation histogram. Some recognition systems use a single stage of feature extractors (Lazebnik, Schmid, and Ponce, 2006; Dalal and Triggs, 2005; Berg, Berg, and Malik, 2005; Pinto, Cox, and DiCarlo, 2008). Other models such as HMAX-type models (Serre, Wolf, and Poggio, 2005; Mutch, and Lowe, 2006) and convolutional networks use two more layers of successive feature extractors. Different training algorithms have been used for learning the parameters of convolutional networks. In LeCun et al.(1998b) and Huang and LeCun (2006), pure supervised learning is used to update the parameters.

The best speed is achieved when the minimum possible number of points is used to estimate hypotheses for the model. Many useful problems can be represented using polynomial constraints (for instance, the determinant of a fundamental matrix must be zero) and so have a number of solutions which are consistent with a minimal set. A considerable amount of effort has been expended on finding the constraints of such problems, and these often require the solution of systems of polynomial equations. We show that better performance can be achieved by using a simple optimization based approach on minimal sets. For a given minimal set, the optimization approach is not guaranteed to converge to the correct solution. However, when used within RANSAC the greater speed and numerical stability results in better performance overall, and much simpler algorithms. We also show that by selecting more than the minimal number of points and using robust optimization can yield better results for very noisy by reducing the number of trials required.

However, while it seems intuitively obvious that unlabelled data can aid the learning process, in practise its performance has often been disappointing. We investigate this by examining generative maximum likelihood semi-supervised learning and derive novel upper and lower bounds on the degree of bias introduced by the unlabelled data. These bounds improve upon those provided in previous work, and are specifically applicable to the challenging case where the model is unable to exactly fit to the underlying distribution a situation which is common in practise, but for which fewer guarantees of semi-supervised performance have been found. Inspired by this new framework for analysing bounds, we propose a new, simple reweighing scheme which provides a provably unbiased estimator for arbitrary model/distribution pairs—an unusual property for a semi-supervised algorithm. This reweighing introduces no additional computational complexity and can be applied to very many models. Additionally, we provide specific conditions demonstrating the circumstance under which the unlabelled data will lower the estimator variance, thereby improving convergence.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：14"}, "url": "http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume15/foxroberts14a/foxroberts14a.pdf", "title": "Unbiased generative semi-supervised learning"}

This master thesis is a part of the SILVERPOLIS project, where Stockholm congestion charging scheme has been analysed using two different types of dynamic simulators: METROPOLIS and SILVESTER.", "学术搜索中的文章": "M Saifuzzaman - 2011"}, "url": "http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:446870", "title": "Modelling the effects of Stockholm Congestion Charges–A comparison of the two dynamic models: Metropolis and Silvester"}

This study investigates the impact of mobile phone conversations on car-following behaviour. The CARRS-Q Advanced Driving Simulator was used to test a group of young Australian drivers aged 18 to 26 years on a car-following task in three randomised phone conditions: baseline (no phone conversation), hands-free and handheld. Repeated measure ANOVA was applied to examine the effect of mobile phone distraction on selected car-following variables such as driving speed, spacing, and time headway. Overall, drivers tended to select slower driving speeds, larger vehicle spacings, and longer time headways when they were engaged in either hands-free or handheld phone conversations, suggesting possible risk compensatory behaviour. In addition, phone conversations while driving influenced car-following behaviour such that variability was increased in driving speeds, vehicle spacings, and acceleration and decelerations. To further investigate car-following behaviour of distracted drivers, driver time headways were modelled using Generalized Estimation Equation (GEE). After controlling for various exogenous factors, the model predicts an increase of 0.33 seconds in time headway when a driver is engaged in hands-free phone conversation and a 0.75 seconds increase for handheld phone conversation. The findings will improve the collective understanding of distraction on driving performance, in particular car following …", "学术搜索中的文章": "M Saifuzzaman, M Haque, Z Zheng, S Washington - 2015"}, "url": "http://eprints.qut.edu.au/79270/", "title": "Effect of mobile phone distraction on car-following behaviour"}

Application of the new method enables the car-following models to realistically reproduce the human factor induced behavior which can help researchers to better understand complex traffic problems caused by human errors, for example, road crashes and traffic jams. The method contains an innovative task difficulty formula, which captures the motivation behind driving decisions. The task difficulty offers a better explanation of human behavior in complex traffic conditions than the conventional measures, such as speed and headway.", "学术搜索中的文章": "M Saifuzzaman - 2016"}, "url": "http://eprints.qut.edu.au/100018/", "title": "Incorporating risk taking and driver errors in car-following models"}
{"data": {"作者": "Mohammad Saifuzzaman, Zuduo Zheng, Md Haque, Simon Washington", "发表日期": "2016", "简介": "Human factors such as distraction, fatigue, alcohol and drug use are generally ignored in car-following (CF) models. Such ignorance overestimates driver capability and leads to most CF models’ inability in realistically explaining human driving behaviors. This paper proposes a novel car-following modeling framework by introducing the difficulty of driving task measured as the dynamic interaction between driving task demand and driver capability. Task difficulty is formulated based on the famous Task Capability Interface (TCI) model, which explains the motivations behind driver’s decision making. The proposed method is applied to enhance the Gipps CF model and the enhanced model is named as TDGipps. The behavioral soundness of TDGipps model is discussed and the steady-state equations are derived. Moreover the enhanced model is calibrated with the vehicle trajectory data, and validated to explain both regular and human factor influenced CF behavior (which is distraction caused by mobile phone conversation in this paper). The model shows better performance than its predecessors especially in presence of human factors.", "学术搜索中的文章": "M Saifuzzaman, Z Zheng, M Haque, S Washington - 2016"}, "url": "https://eprints.qut.edu.au/117957/", "title": "Incorporating human factors into Gipps car-following model"}

Next, these features are used as input in the segment-based mixture model that learns complex data distributions and their parameters. Then, we use the Mahalanobis distance to determine whether the traffic observation corresponds to an incident or recurrent traffic state.

A better understanding of the incident behavior is needed to minimize this error. This study explores 77 motorway incidents and their impacts on occupancy, flow and speed profile at the nearest upstream and downstream detector locations. The analysis discovers that an incident is likely to create a difference in occupancy and speed profile between the upstream and downstream detectors. At the same time, the incident creates a disturbance in the flow which significantly reduces the roadway capacity. A new IDA is proposed based on the famous California# 7 algorithm. The proposed California# 7 with flow (CWF) algorithm includes a flow drop test to reduce the false detection rate. Both the algorithms have been properly calibrated and validated with the collected data. The validation result shows a significant improvement in the reduction of the false detection rate.

A close connection between the TD profile and evolution (such as formation and growth) of the stop-and-go traffic oscillations is found. Furthermore, driver behaviors inside the oscillations are identified based on driver's TD profile, and their connection with hysteresis magnitudes is established. Finally, a generalized linear model suggests that variables related to traffic flow and driver characteristics are significant predictors of hysteresis magnitude.
